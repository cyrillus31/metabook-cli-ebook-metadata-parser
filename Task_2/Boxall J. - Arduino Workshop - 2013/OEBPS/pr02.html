Without your vision, thought, and hard work, none of this would have been possible.</p><p>Many thanks to my technical reviewer Marc Alexander for his contributions, expertise, suggestions, support, thoughts, and long conversations, and for having the tenacity to follow through with such a large project.</p><p>I also want to thank the following organizations for their images and encouragement: adafruit industries, Agilent Technologies, Gravitech, Freetronics, Oomlout, Seeed Studio, Sharp Corporation, and SparkFun. Furthermore, a big thanks to Freetronics for the use of their excellent hardware products. And thank you to all those who have contributed their time making Arduino libraries, which makes life much easier for everyone.</p><p>Kudos and thanks to the Fritzing team for their wonderful open source circuit schematic design tool, which I’ve used throughout this book.</p><p>And a thank you to the following people (in no particular order) from whom I’ve received encouragement, inspiration and support: Iraphne Childs, Limor Fried, Jonathan Oxer, Philip Lindsay, Nicole Kilah, Ken Shirriff, Nathan Kennedy, David Jones, and Nathan Seidle.</p><p>Finally, thank you to everyone at No Starch Press, including Sondra Silverhawk for suggesting the book; Serena Yang for her dedicated editing, endless patience, and suggestions; and Bill Pollock for his support and guidance and for convincing me that sometimes there is a better way to explain something.</p></section></body></html>
