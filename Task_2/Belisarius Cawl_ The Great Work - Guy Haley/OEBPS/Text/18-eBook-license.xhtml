			<p class="Ebook_license_01">* 8. These terms and conditions shall be governed by English law, and shall be subject only to the jurisdiction of the Courts in England and Wales.</p>
			<p class="Ebook_license_01">* 9. If any part of this license is illegal, or becomes illegal as a result of any change in the law, then that part shall be deleted, and replaced with wording that is as close to the original meaning as possible without being illegal.</p>
			<p class="Ebook_license_01">* 10.
