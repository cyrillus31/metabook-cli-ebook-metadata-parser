<body class="x-ebookmaker x-ebookmaker-2"><p>To give a colour to their idleness the gipsies employ themselves in
working in iron, and you may always see them hawking pincers, tongs,
hammers, fire-shovels, and so forth, the sale of which facilitates their
thefts. The women are all midwives, and in this they have the advantage
over others, for they bring forth without cost or attendants. They wash
their new-born infants in cold water, and accustom them from birth to
death to endure every inclemency of weather. Hence they are all strong,
robust, nimble leapers, runners, and dancers. They always marry among
themselves, in order that their bad practices may not come to be known,
except by their own people. The women are well behaved to their
husbands, and few of them intrigue except with persons of their own
race. When they seek for alms, it is rather by tricks and juggling than
by appeals to charity; and as no one puts faith in them, they keep none,
but own themselves downright vagabonds; nor do I remember to have ever
seen a gipsy-woman taking the sacrament, though I have often been in the
churches. The only thoughts of their minds are how to cheat and steal.
They are fond of talking about their thefts and how they effected them.
A gipsy, for instance, related one day in my presence how he had
swindled a countryman as you shall hear:</p>
<p>The gipsy had an ass with a docked tail, and he fitted a false tail to
the stump so well that it seemed quite natural. Then he took the ass to
market and sold it to a countryman for ten ducats. Having pocketed the
money, he told the countryman that if he wanted another ass, own brother
to the one he had bought, and every bit as good, he might have it a
bargain. The countryman told him to go and fetch it, and meanwhile he
would drive that one home. Away went the purchaser; the gipsy followed
him, and some how or other, it was not long before he had stolen the
ass, from which he immediately whipped off the false tail, leaving only
a bare stump. He then changed the halter and saddle, and had the
audacity to go and offer the animal for sale to the countryman, before
the latter had discovered his loss. The bargain was soon made; the
purchaser went into his house to fetch the money to pay for the second
ass, and there he discovered the loss of the first. Stupid as he was, he
suspected that the gipsy had stolen the animal, and he refused to pay
him. The gipsy brought forward as witness the man who had received the
alcabala<a id="FNanchor_63_63"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-6.htm.html#Footnote_63_63" class="pginternal"><sup>[63]</sup></a> on the first transaction, and who swore that he had sold
the countryman an ass with a very bushy tail, quite different from the
second one; and an alguazil, who was present, took the gipsy's part so
strongly that the countryman was forced to pay for the ass twice over.
Many other stories they told, all about stealing beasts of burden, in
which art they are consummate masters. In short, they are a thoroughly
bad race, and though many able magistrates have taken them in hand, they
have always remained incorrigible.</p>
<p>After I had remained with them twenty days, they set out for Murcia,
taking me with them. We passed through Granada, where the company was
quartered to which my master the drummer belonged. As the gipsies were
aware of this, they shut me up in the place where they were lodged. I
overheard them talking about their journey, and thinking that no good
would come of it, I contrived to give them the slip, quitted Granada,
and entered the garden of a Morisco,<a id="FNanchor_64_64"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-6.htm.html#Footnote_64_64" class="pginternal"><sup>[64]</sup></a> who gladly received me. I was
quite willing to remain with him and watch his garden,—a much less
fatiguing business in my opinion than guarding a flock of sheep; and as
there was no need to discuss the question of wages, the Morisco soon had
a servant and I a master. I remained with him more than a month, not
that the life I led with him was much to my liking, but because it gave
me opportunities of observing that of my master, which was like that of
all the other Moriscoes in Spain. O what curious things I could tell
you, friend Scipio, about that half Paynim rabble, if I were not afraid
that I should not get to the end of my story in a fortnight! Nay, if I
were to go into particulars, two months would not be enough. Some few
specimens, however, you shall hear.</p>
<p>Hardly will you find among the whole race one man who is a sincere
believer in the holy law of Christianity. Their only thought is how to
scrape up money and keep it; and to this end they toil incessantly and
spend nothing. The moment a real falls into their clutches, they condemn
it to perpetual imprisonment; so that by dint of perpetually
accumulating and never spending, they have got the greater part of the
money of Spain into their hands. They are the grubs, the magpies, the
weasels of the nation. Consider how numerous they are, and that every
day they add much or little to their hoards, and that as they increase
in number so the amount of their hoarded wealth must increase without
end. None of them of either sex make monastic vows, but all marry and
multiply, for thrifty living is a great promoter of fecundity. They are
not wasted by war or excessive toil; they plunder us in a quiet way, and
enrich themselves with the fruits of our patrimonies which they sell
back to us. They have no servants, for they all wait upon themselves.
They are at no expense for the education of their sons, for all their
lore is but how to rob us. From the twelve sons of Jacob, who entered
Egypt, as I have heard, there had sprung, when Moses freed them from
captivity, six hundred thousand fighting men, besides women and
children. From this we may infer how much the Moriscoes have multiplied,
and how incomparably greater must be their numbers.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Means have been sought for remedying the mischiefs you have
mentioned and hinted at; and, indeed, I am sure that those which you
have passed over in silence, are even more serious than those which you
have touched upon. But our commonwealth has most wise and zealous
champions, who, considering that Spain produces and retains in her bosom
such vipers as the Moriscoes, will, with God's help, provide a sure and
prompt remedy for so great an evil. Go on.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> My master being a stingy hunks, like all his caste, I lived
like himself chiefly on maize bread and buckwheat porridge; but this
penury helped me to gain paradise, in the strange manner you shall hear.
Every morning, by daybreak, a young man used to seat himself at the foot
of one of the many pomegranate trees. He had the look of a student,
being dressed in a rusty suit of threadbare baize, and was occupied in
writing in a note book, slapping his forehead from time to time, biting
his nails, and gazing up at the sky. Sometimes he was so immersed in
reverie, that he neither moved hand nor foot, nor even winked his eyes.
One day I drew near him unperceived, and heard him muttering between
his teeth. At last, after a long silence, he cried out aloud, "Glorious!
The very best verse I ever composed in my life!" and down went something
in his note book. From all this, it was plain that the luckless wight
was a poet. I approached him with my ordinary courtesies, and when I had
convinced him of my gentleness, he let me lie down at his feet, and
resumed the course of his thoughts, scratching his head, falling into
ecstacies, and then writing as before.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there came into the garden another young man, handsome and
well dressed, with papers in his hand, at which he glanced from time to
time. The new comer walked up to the pomegranate tree, and said to the
poet, "Have you finished the first act?"</p>
<p>"I have just this moment finished it in the happiest manner possible,"
was the reply.</p>
<p>"How is that?"</p>
<p>"I will tell you! His Holiness the Pope comes forth in his pontificals,
with twelve cardinals in purple canonicals—for the action of my comedy
is supposed to take place at the season of <i>mutatio caparum</i>, when their
eminences are not dressed in scarlet but in purple—therefore propriety
absolutely requires that my cardinals should wear purple. This is a
capital point, and one on which your common run of writers would be sure
to blunder; but as for me I could not go wrong, for I have read the
whole Roman ceremonial through, merely that I might be exact as to these
dresses."</p>
<p>"But where do you suppose," said the other, "that our manager is to find
purple robes for twelve cardinals?"</p>
<p>"If a single one is wanting," cried the poet, "I would as soon think of
flying, as of letting my comedy be represented without it. Zounds! is
the public to lose that magnificent spectacle! Just imagine the splendid
effect on the stage of a supreme Pontiff and twelve grave cardinals,
with all the other dignitaries, who will of course accompany them! By
heavens, it will be one of the grandest things ever seen on the stage,
not excepting even the nosegay of Duraja!"</p>
<p>I now perceived that one of these young men was a poet, and the other a
comedian. The latter advised the former that he should cut out a few of
his cardinals, if he did not want to make it impossible for the manager
to produce the piece. The poet would not listen to this, but said they
might be thankful that he had not brought in the whole conclave, to be
present at the memorable event which he proposed to immortalise in his
brilliant comedy. The player laughed, left him to his occupation, and
returned to his own, which was studying a part in a new play. The poet,
after having committed to writing some verses of his magnificent comedy,
slowly and gravely drew from his pocket some morsels of bread, and about
twenty raisins, or perhaps not so many, for there were some crumbs of
bread among them, which increased their apparent number. He blew the
crumbs from the raisins, and ate them one by one, stalks and all, for I
did not see him throw anything away, adding to them the pieces of bread,
which had got such a colour from the lining of his pocket, that they
looked mouldy, and were so hard that he could not get them down, though
he chewed them over and over again. This was lucky for me, for he threw
them to me, saying, "Catch, dog, and much good may it do you." Look,
said I to myself, what nectar and ambrosia this poet gives me; for that
is the food on which they say these sons of Apollo are nourished. In
short, great for the most part is the penury of poets; but greater was
my need, since it obliged me to eat what he left.</p>
<p>As long as he was busy with the composition of his comedy he did not
fail to visit the garden, nor did I want crusts, for he shared them with
me very liberally; and then we went to the well, where we satisfied our
thirst like monarchs, I lapping, and he drinking out of a pitcher. But
at last the poet came no more, and my hunger became so intolerable, that
I resolved to quit the Morisco and seek my fortune in the city. As I
entered it, I saw my poet coming out of the famous monastery of San
Geronimo. He came to me with open arms, and I was no less delighted to
see him. He immediately began to empty his pockets of pieces of bread,
softer than those he used to, carry to the garden, and to put them
between my teeth without passing them through his own. From the softness
of the bits of bread, and my having seen my poet come out of the
monastery, I surmised that his muse, like that of many of his brethren,
was a bashful beggar. He walked into the city, and I followed him,
intending to take him for my master if he would let me, thinking that
the crumbs from his table might serve to support me, since there is no
better or ampler purse than charity, whose liberal hands are never poor.</p>
<p>After some time, we arrived at the house of a theatrical manager, called
Angulo the Bad, to distinguish him from another Angulo, not a manager
but a player, one of the best ever seen. The whole company was assembled
to hear my master's comedy read; but before the first act was half
finished, all had vanished, one by one, except the manager and myself,
who formed the whole audience. The comedy was such that to me, who am
but an ass in such matters, it seemed as though Satan himself had
composed it for the utter ruin and perdition of the poet; and I actually
shivered with vexation to see the solitude in which his audience had
left him. I wonder did his prophetic soul presage to him the disgrace
impending over him; for all the players—and there were more than twelve
of them—came back, laid hold on the poet, without saying a word, and,
had it not been for the authoritative interference of the manager, they
would have tossed him in a blanket. I was confounded by this sad turn of
affairs, the manager was incensed, the players very merry; and the poor
forlorn poet, with great patience, but a somewhat wry face, took the
comedy, thrust it into his bosom, muttering, "It is not right to cast
pearls before swine," and sadly quitted the place without another word.
I was so mortified and ashamed that I could not follow him, and the
manager caressed me so much that I was obliged to remain; and within a
month I became an excellent performer in interludes and pantomimes.
Interludes, you know, usually end with a cudgelling bout, but in my
master's theatre they ended with setting me at the characters of the
piece, whom I worried and tumbled one over the other, to the huge
delight of the ignorant spectators, and my master's great gain.</p>
<p>Oh, Scipio! what things I could tell you that I saw among these
players, and two other companies to which I belonged; but I must leave
them for another day, for it would be impossible to compress them within
moderate limits. All you have heard is nothing to what I could relate to
you about these people and their ways, their work and their idleness,
their ignorance and their cleverness, and other matters without end,
which might serve to disenchant many who idolise these fictitious
divinities.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> I see clearly, Berganza, that the field is large; but leave it
now, and go on.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I arrived with a company of players in this city of Valladolid,
where they gave me a wound in an interlude that was near being the death
of me. I could not revenge myself then, because I was muzzled, and I had
no mind to do so afterwards in cold blood; for deliberate vengeance
argues a cruel and malicious disposition. I grew weary of this
employment, not because it was laborious, but because I saw in it many
things which called for amendment and castigation; and, as it was not in
my power to remedy them, I resolved to see them no more, but to take
refuge in an abode of holiness, as those do who forsake their vices when
they can no longer practise them; but better late than never. Well,
then, seeing you one night carrying the lantern with that good Christian
Mahudes, I noticed how contented you were, how righteous and holy was
your occupation. Filled with honest emulation, I longed to follow your
steps; and, with that laudable intention, I placed myself before
Mahudes, who immediately elected me your companion, and brought me to
this hospital. What has occurred to me since I have been here would take
some time to relate. I will just mention a conversation I heard between
four invalids, who lay in four beds next each other. It will not take
long to tell, and it fits in here quite pat.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Very well; but be quick, for, to the best of my belief, it
cannot be far from daylight.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> The four beds were at the end of the infirmary, and in them lay
an alchemist, a poet, a mathematician, and one of those persons who are
called projectors.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> I recollect these good people well.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> One afternoon, last summer, the windows being closed, I lay
panting under one of their beds, when the poet began piteously to
bewail his ill fortune. The mathematician asked him what he complained
of.</p>
<p>"Have I not good cause for complaint?" he replied. "I have strictly
observed the rule laid down by Horace in his Art of Poetry, not to bring
to light any work until ten years after it has been composed. Now, I
have a work on which I was engaged for twenty years, and which has lain
by me for twelve. The subject is sublime, the invention perfectly novel,
the episodes singularly happy, the versification noble, and the
arrangement admirable, for the beginning is in perfect correspondence
with the middle and the end. Altogether it is a lofty, sonorous, heroic
poem, delectable and full of matter; and yet I cannot find a prince to
whom I may dedicate it—a prince, I say, who is intelligent, liberal,
and magnanimous. Wretched and depraved age this of ours!"</p>
<p>"What is the subject of the work?" inquired the alchemist.</p>
<p>"It treats," said the poet, "of that part of the history of king Arthur
of England which archbishop Turpin left unwritten, together with the
history of the quest of the Sangreal, the whole in heroic measure,—part
rhymes, part blank-verse; and in dactyles moreover, that is to say, in
dactylic noun substantives, without any admission of verbs."</p>
<p>"For my part, I am not much of a judge in matters of poetry," returned
the alchemist, "and therefore I cannot precisely estimate the misfortune
you complain of; but in any case it cannot equal my own in wanting
means, or a prince to back me and supply me with the requisites, for
prosecuting the science of alchemy; but for which want alone I should
now be rolling in gold, and richer than ever was Midas, Crassus, or
Croesus."</p>
<p>"Have you ever succeeded, Señor Alchemist," said the mathematician, "in
extracting gold from the other metals?"</p>
<p>"I have not yet extracted it," the alchemist replied, "but I know for
certain that the thing is to be done, and that in less than two months
more I could complete the discovery of the philosopher's stone, by means
of which gold can be made even out of pebbles."</p>
<p>"Your worships," rejoined the mathematician, "have both of you made a
great deal of your misfortunes; but after all, one of you has a book to
dedicate, and the other is on the point of discovering the
philosopher's stone, by means of which he will be as rich as all those
who have followed that course. But what will you say of my misfortune,
which is great beyond compare? For two and twenty years I have been in
pursuit of the fixed point; here I miss it, there I get sight of it
again, and just when it seems that I am down upon it so that it can by
no means escape me, I find myself on a sudden so far away from it that I
am utterly amazed. It is just the same with the quadrature of the
circle. I have been within such a hair's breadth of it, that I cannot
conceive how it is that I have not got it in my pocket. Thus I suffer a
torment like that of Tantalus, who starves with fruits all round him,
and burns with thirst with water at his lip. At one moment I seem to
grasp the truth, at another it is far away from me; and, like another
Sisyphus, I begin again to climb the hill which I have just rolled down,
along with all the mass of my labours."</p>
<p>The projector, who had hitherto kept silence, now struck in. "Here we
are," he said, "four complainants, brought together by poverty under the
roof of this hospital. To the devil with such callings and employments,
as give neither pleasure nor bread to those who exercise them! I,
gentlemen, am a projector, and have at various times offered sundry
valuable projects to his majesty, all to his advantage, and without
prejudice to the realm; and I have now a memorial in which I supplicate
his majesty to appoint a person to whom I may communicate a new project
of mine, which will be the means of entirely liquidating all his debts.
But from the fate which all my other memorials have had, I foresee that
this one also will be thrown into the dust-hole. Lest, however, your
worships should think me crack-brained, I will explain my project to
you, though this be in some degree a publication of my secret.</p>
<p>"I propose that all his majesty's vassals, from the age of fourteen to
sixty, be bound once a month, on a certain appointed day, to fast on
bread and water; and that the whole expenditure, which would otherwise
be made on that day for food, including fruit, meat, fish, wine, eggs,
and vegetables, be turned into money, and the amount paid to his
majesty, without defrauding him of a doit, as each shall declare on
oath. By this means, in the course of twenty years the king will be
freed from all debts and incumbrances. The calculation is easily made.
There are in Spain more than three millions of persons of the specified
age, exclusive of invalids, old, and young, and there is not one of
these but spends at least a real and a half daily; however, I am willing
to put it at a real only, and less it cannot be, even were they to eat
nothing but leeks. Now does it not strike your worships that it would be
no bad thing to realise every month three millions of reals, all net and
clear as if they were winnowed and sifted? The plan, moreover, instead
of a loss to his majesty's subjects, would be a real advantage to them;
for by means of their fasts they would make themselves acceptable to God
and would serve their king, and some of them even might find it
beneficial to their health. The project is in every way admirable, as
you must confess; the money too might be collected by parishes, without
the cost of tax gatherers and receivers, those plagues and bloodsuckers
of the realm."</p>
<p>The others all laughed at the projector's scheme, and even he himself
joined in the laugh at last. For my part I found much matter for
reflection in the strange conversation I had heard, and in the fact that
people such as these usually end their days in a hospital.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> That is true, Berganza. Have you anything more to say?</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Two things more and then I shall have done, for I think day is
beginning to dawn. One day I accompanied Mahudes to ask for alms in the
house of the corregidor of this city, who is a great cavalier and a very
great Christian. We found him alone, and I thought fit to take advantage
of that opportunity to give him certain counsels which I had gathered
from the lips of an old invalid in this hospital, who was discussing the
means of saving from perdition those vagabond girls who take to a life
of vice to avoid labour,—an intolerable evil demanding an immediate and
effectual remedy. Wishing to impart what I had heard to the corregidor,
I lifted up my voice, thinking to speak; but instead of articulate
speech I barked so loudly that the corregidor called out in a passion to
his servants to drive me out of the room with sticks; whereupon one of
them caught up a copper syphon, which Was the nearest thing at hand, and
thrashed me with it so, that I feel it in my ribs to this hour.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> And do you complain of that, Berganza?</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Nay; have I not reason to complain, since I feel the pain even
now; and since it appears to me that my good intentions merited no such
chastisement?</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Look you, Berganza, no one should interfere where he is not
wanted, nor take upon himself a business that in no wise is his concern.
Besides, you ought to know, that the advice of the poor, however good it
may be, is never taken; nor should the lowly presume to offer advice to
the great, who fancy they know everything. Wisdom in a poor man lies
under a cloud, and cannot be seen; or if by chance it shines through it,
people mistake it for folly, and treat it with contempt.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> You are right, Scipio; and having had the lesson well beaten
into me, I will henceforth act accordingly. That same night I entered
the house of a lady of quality, who had in her arms a little lap-dog, so
very diminutive that she could have hid it in her bosom. The instant it
saw me, it flew at me out of its mistress's arms, barking with all its
might, and even went so far as to bite my leg. I looked at it with
disgust, and said to myself, "If I met you in the street, paltry little
animal, either I would take no notice of you at all, or I would make
mince meat of you." The little wretch was an example of the common
rule—that mean-souled persons when they are in favour are always
insolent, and ready to offend those who are much better than themselves,
though inferior to them in fortune.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> We have many instances of this in worthless fellows, who are
insolent enough under cover of their masters' protection; but if death
or any other chance brings down the tree against which they leaned,
their true value becomes apparent, since they have no other merit than
that borrowed from their patrons; whilst virtue and good sense are
always the same, whether clothed or naked, alone or accompanied. But let
us break off now; for the light beaming in through those chinks shows
that the dawn is far advanced.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Be it so; and I trust in heaven that to-night we shall find
ourselves in a condition to renew our conversation.</p>
<p>The licentiate finished the reading of this dialogue, and the Alferez
his nap, both at the same time. "Although this colloquy is manifestly
fictitious," said the licentiate, "it is, in my opinion, so well
composed, that the Señor Alferez may well proceed with the second part."</p>
<p>"Since you give me such encouragement, I will do so," replied the
alferez, "without further discussing the question with you, whether the
dogs spoke or not."</p>
<p>"There is no need that we should go over that ground again," said the
licentiate. "I admire the art and the invention you have displayed in
the dialogue, and that is enough. Let us go to the Espolon,<a id="FNanchor_65_65"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-6.htm.html#Footnote_65_65" class="pginternal"><sup>[65]</sup></a> and
recreate our bodily eyes, as we have gratified those of our minds."</p>
<p>"With all my heart," said the alferez, and away they went.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00012"><a id="THE_LITTLE_GIPSY_GIRL"/>THE LITTLE GIPSY GIRL.</h2>
<p>It would almost seem that the Gitanos and Gitanas, or male and female
gipsies, had been sent into the world for the sole purpose of thieving.
Born of parents who are thieves, reared among thieves, and educated as
thieves, they finally go forth perfected in their vocation, accomplished
at all points, and ready for every species of roguery. In them the love
of thieving, and the ability to exercise it, are qualities inseparable
from their existence, and never lost until the hour of their death.</p>
<p>Now it chanced that an old woman of this race, one who had merited
retirement on full pay as a veteran in the ranks of Cacus, brought up a
girl whom she called Preciosa, and declared to be her granddaughter. To
this child she imparted all her own acquirements, all the various tricks
of her art. Little Preciosa became the most admired dancer in all the
tribes of Gipsydom; she was the most beautiful and discreet of all their
maidens; nay she shone conspicuous not only among the gipsies, but even
as compared with the most lovely and accomplished damsels whose praises
were at that time sounded forth by the voice of fame. Neither sun, nor
wind, nor all those vicissitudes of weather, to which the gipsies are
more constantly exposed than any other people, could impair the bloom of
her complexion or embrown her hands; and what is more remarkable, the
rude manner in which she was reared only served to reveal that she must
have sprung from something better than the Gitano stock; for she was
extremely pleasing and courteous in conversation, and lively though she
was, yet in no wise did she display the least unseemly levity; on the
contrary, amidst all her sprightliness, there was at the same time so
much genuine decorum in her manner, that in the presence of Preciosa no
gitana, old or young, ever dared to sing lascivious songs, or utter
unbecoming words.</p>
<p>The grandmother fully perceived what a treasure she had in her
grandchild; and the old eagle determined to set her young eaglet flying,
having been careful to teach her how to live by her talons. Preciosa was
rich in hymns, ballads, seguidillas, sarabands, and other ditties,
especially romances, which she sang with peculiar grace; for the cunning
grandmother knew by experience that such accomplishments, added to the
youth and beauty of her granddaughter, were the best means of increasing
her capital, and therefore she failed not to promote their cultivation
in every way she could. Nor was the aid of poets wanting; for some there
are who do not disdain to write for the gipsies, as there are those who
invent miracles for the pretended blind, and go snacks with them in what
they gain from charitable believers.</p>
<p>During her childhood, Preciosa lived in different parts of Castile; but
in her sixteenth year her grandmother brought her to Madrid, to the
usual camping-ground of the gipsies, in the fields of Santa Barbara.
Madrid seemed to her the most likely place to find customers; for there
everything is bought and sold. Preciosa made her first appearance in the
capital on the festival of Santa Anna, the patroness of the city, when
she took part in a dance performed by eight gitanas, with one gitano, an
excellent dancer, to lead them. The others were all very well, but such
was the elegance of Preciosa, that she fascinated the eyes of all the
spectators. Amidst the sound of the tambourine and castanets, in the
heat of the dance, a murmur of admiration arose for the beauty and grace
of Preciosa; but when they heard her sing—for the dance was accompanied
with song—the fame of the gitana reached its highest point; and by
common consent the jewel offered as the prize of the best dancer in that
festival was adjudged to her. After the usual dance in the church of
Santa Maria, before the image of the glorious Santa Anna, Preciosa
caught up a tambourine, well furnished with bells, and having cleared a
wide circle around her with pirouettes of exceeding lightness, she sang
a hymn to the patroness of the day. It was the admiration of all who
heard her. Some said, "God bless the girl!" Others, "'Tis a pity that
this maiden is a gitana: truly she deserves to be the daughter of some
great lord!" Others more coarsely observed, "Let the wench grow up, and
she will show you pretty tricks; she is closing the meshes of a very
nice net to fish for hearts." Another more good-natured but ill-bred
and stupid, seeing her foot it so lightly, "Keep it up! keep it up!
Courage, darling! Grind the dust to atoms!" "Never fear," she answered,
without losing a step; "I'll grind it to atoms."</p>
<p>At the vespers and feast of Santa Anna Preciosa was somewhat fatigued;
but so celebrated had she become for beauty, wit, and discretion, as
well as for her dancing, that nothing else was talked of throughout the
capital. A fortnight afterwards, she returned to Madrid, with three
other girls, provided with their tambourines and a new dance, besides a
new stock of romances and songs, but all of a moral character; for
Preciosa would never permit those in her company to sing immodest songs,
nor would she ever sing them herself. The old gitana came with her, for
she now watched her as closely as Argus, and never left her side, lest
some one should carry her off. She called her granddaughter, and the
girl believed herself to be her grandchild.</p>
<p>The young gitanas began their dance in the shade, in the Calle de
Toledo, and were soon encircled by a crowd of spectators. Whilst they
danced, the old woman gathered money among the bystanders, and they
showered it down like stones on the highway; for beauty has such power
that it can awaken slumbering charity. The dance over, Preciosa said,
"If you will give me four quartos, I will sing by myself a beautiful
romance about the churching of our lady the Queen Doña Margarita. It is
a famous composition, by a poet of renown, one who may be called a
captain in the battalion of poets." No sooner had she said this, than
almost every one in the ring cried out, "Sing it, Preciosa; here are my
four quartos;" and so many quartos were thrown down for her, that the
old gitana had not hands enough to pick them up. When the gathering was
ended, Preciosa resumed her tambourine, and sang the promised romance,
which was loudly encored, the whole audience crying out with one voice,
"Sing again, Preciosa, sing again, and dance for us, girl: thou shalt
not want quartos, whilst thou hast the ground beneath thy feet."</p>
<p>Whilst more than two hundred persons were thus looking on at the dance,
and listening to the singing of the gitana, one of the lieutenants of
the city passed by; and seeing so many people together, he asked what
was the occasion of the crowd. Being told that the handsome gitana was
singing there, the lieutenant, who was not without curiosity, drew near
also to listen, but in consideration of his dignity, he did not wait for
the end of the romance. The gitanilla, however, pleased him so much,
that he sent his page to tell the old crone to come to his house that
evening with her troop, as he wished his wife Doña Clara to hear them.
The page delivered the message, and the old gitana promised to attend.</p>
<p>After the performance was ended, and the performers were going
elsewhere, a very well-dressed page came up to Preciosa, and giving her
a folded paper, said, "Pretty Preciosa, will you sing this romance? It
is a very good one, and I will give you others from time to time, by
which you will acquire the fame of having the best romances in the
world."</p>
<p>"I will learn this one with much willingness," replied Preciosa; "and be
sure, señor, you bring me the others you speak of, but on condition that
there is nothing improper in them. If you wish to be paid for them, we
will agree for them by the dozen; but do not expect to be paid in
advance; that will be impossible. When a dozen have been sung, the money
for a dozen shall be forthcoming."</p>
<p>"If the Señora Preciosa only pays me for the paper," said the page, "I
shall be content. Moreover, any romance which does not turn out so well
shall not be counted."</p>
<p>"I will retain the right of choice," said Preciosa; and then she
continued her way with her companions up the street, when some gentlemen
called and beckoned to them from a latticed window. Preciosa went up and
looked through the window, which was near the ground, into a cheerful,
well-furnished apartment, in which several cavaliers were walking about,
and others playing at various games. "Will you give me a share of your
winnings, señors?" said Preciosa, in the lisping accent of the gipsies,
which she spoke not by nature but from choice. At the sight of Preciosa,
and at the sound of her voice, the players quitted the tables, the rest
left off lounging, and all thronged to the window, for her fame had
already reached them. "Come in! Let the little gipsies come in," said
the cavaliers, gaily; "we will certainly give them a share of our
winnings."</p>
<p>"But you might make it cost us dear, señors," said Preciosa.</p>
<p>"No, on the honour of gentlemen," said one, "you may come in, niña, in
full security that no one will touch the sole of your shoe. I swear this
to you by the order I wear on my breast;" and as he spoke he laid his
hand on the cross of the order of Calatrava which he wore.</p>
<p>"If you like to go in, Preciosa," said one of the gitanillas who were
with her, "do so by all means; but I do not choose to go where there are
so many men."</p>
<p>"Look you, Christina," answered Preciosa, "what you have to beware of is
one man alone; where there are so many there is nothing to fear. Of one
thing you may be sure, Christina; the woman who is resolved to be
upright may be so amongst an army of soldiers. It is well, indeed, to
avoid occasions of temptation, but it is not in crowded rooms like this
that danger lurks."</p>
<p>"Well then, let us go in, Preciosa," said her companion, "you know more
than a witch."</p>
<p>The old gipsy also encouraged them to go in, and that decided the
question. As soon as they had entered the room, the cavalier of the
order, seeing the paper which Preciosa carried, stretched out his hand
to take it. "Do not take it from me," she said: "It is a romance but
just given to me, and which I have not yet had time to read."</p>
<p>"And do you know how to read, my girl?" said one of the cavaliers.</p>
<p>"Ay, and to write too," said the old woman. "I have brought up my
grandchild as if she was a lawyer's daughter."</p>
<p>The cavalier opened the paper, and finding a gold crown inclosed in it,
said, "Truly, Preciosa, the contents of this letter are worth the
postage. Here is a crown inclosed in the romance."</p>
<p>"The poet has treated me like a beggar," said Preciosa; "but it is
certainly a greater marvel for one of his trade to give a crown than for
one of mine to receive it. If his romances come to me with this
addition, he may transscribe the whole <i>Romancero General</i> and send me
every piece in it one by one. I will weigh their merit; and if I find
there is good matter in them, I will not reject them. Read the paper
aloud, señor, that we may see if the poet is as wise as he is liberal."
The cavalier accordingly read as follows:—</p>

<p>"The poem ends with 'poor' in the last line," said Preciosa; "and that
is a bad sign. Lovers should never begin by saying that they are poor,
for poverty, it strikes me, is a great enemy to love."</p>
<p>"Who teaches you these things, girl?" said one of the cavaliers.</p>
<p>"Who should teach me?" she replied. "Have I not a soul in my body? Am I
not fifteen years of age? I am neither lame, nor halt, nor maimed in my
understanding. The wit of a gipsy girl steers by a different compass
from that which guides other people. They are always forward for their
years. There is no such thing as a stupid gitano, or a silly gitana.
Since it is only by being sharp and ready that they can earn a
livelihood, they polish their wits at every step, and by no means let
the moss grow under their feet. You see these girls, my companions, who
are so silent. You may think they are simpletons, but put your fingers
in their mouths to see if they have cut their wise teeth; and then you
shall see what you shall see. There is not a gipsy girl of twelve who
does not know as much as one of another race at five-and-twenty, for
they have the devil and much practice for instructors, so that they
learn in one hour what would otherwise take them a year."</p>
<p>The company were much amused by the gitana's chat, and all gave her
money. The old woman sacked thirty reals, and went off with her flock as
merry as a cricket to the house of the señor lieutenant, after promising
that she would return with them another day to please such liberal
gentlemen. Doña Clara, the lieutenant's lady, had been apprised of the
intended visit of the gipsies, and she and her doncellas and dueñas, as
well as those of another señora, her neighbour, were expecting them as
eagerly as one looks for a shower in May. They had come to see Preciosa.
She entered with her companions, shining among them like a torch among
lesser lights, and all the ladies pressed towards her. Some kissed her,
some gazed at her; others blessed her sweet face, others her graceful
carriage. "This, indeed, is what you may call golden hair," cried Doña
Clara; "these are truly emerald eyes."<a id="FNanchor_67_67"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-8.htm.html#Footnote_67_67" class="pginternal"><sup>[67]</sup></a> The señora, her neighbour,
examined the gitanilla piecemeal. She made a <i>pepetoria</i><a id="FNanchor_68_68"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-8.htm.html#Footnote_68_68" class="pginternal"><sup>[68]</sup></a> of all her
joints and members, and coming at last to a dimple in her chin, she
said, "Oh, what a dimple! it is a pit into which all eyes that behold it
must fall." Thereupon an esquire in attendance on Doña Clara, an elderly
gentleman with a long beard, exclaimed, "Call you this a dimple, señora?
I know little of dimples then if this be one. It is no dimple, but a
grave of living desires. I vow to God the gitanilla is such a dainty
creature, she could not be better if she was made of silver or sugar
paste. Do you know how to tell fortunes, niña?"</p>
<p>"That I do, and in three or four different manners," replied Preciosa.</p>
<p>"You can do that too?" exclaimed Doña Clara. "By the life of my lord the
lieutenant, you must tell me mine, niña of gold, niña of silver, niña of
pearls, niña of carbuncles, niña of heaven, and more than that cannot be
said."</p>
<p>"Give the niña the palm of your hand, señora, and something to cross it
with," said the old gipsy; "and you will see what things she will tell
you, for she knows more than a doctor of medicine."</p>
<p>The señora Tenienta<a id="FNanchor_69_69"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-8.htm.html#Footnote_69_69" class="pginternal"><sup>[69]</sup></a> put her hand in her pocket, but found it empty;
she asked for the loan of a quarto from her maids, but none of them had
one, neither had the señora her neighbour. Preciosa seeing this, said,
"For the matter of crosses all are good, but those made with silver or
gold are best. As for making the sign of the cross with copper money,
that, ladies, you must know lessens the luck, at least it does mine. I
always like to begin by crossing the palm with a good gold crown, or a
piece of eight, or at least a quarto, for, I am like the sacristans who
rejoice when there is a good collection."</p>
<p>"How witty you are," said the lady visitor; then turning to the squire,
"Do you happen to have a quarto about you, Señor Contreras? if you have,
give it me, and when my husband the doctor comes you shall have it
again."</p>
<p>"I have one," replied Contreras, "but it is pledged for two-and-twenty
maravedis for my supper; give me so much and I will fly to fetch it."</p>
<p>"We have not a quarto amongst us all," said Doña Clara, "and you ask
for two-and-twenty maravedis? Go your ways, Contreras, for a tiresome
blockhead, as you always were."</p>
<p>One of the damsels present, seeing the penury of the house, said to
Preciosa, "Niña, will it be of any use to make the cross with a silver
thimble?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," said Preciosa; "the best crosses in the world are made with
silver thimbles, provided there are plenty of them."</p>
<p>"I have one," said the doncella; "if that is enough, here it is, on
condition that my fortune be told too."</p>
<p>"So many fortunes to be told for a thimble!" exclaimed the old gipsy.
"Make haste, granddaughter, for it will soon be night." Preciosa took
the thimble, and began her sooth saying.</p>
