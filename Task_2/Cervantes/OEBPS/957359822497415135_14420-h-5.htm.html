<body class="x-ebookmaker x-ebookmaker-2"><p><i>Scip.</i> You say very true, Berganza; for there is no worse or more
subtle thief than the domestic thief; and accordingly there die many
more of those who are trustful than of those who are wary. But the
misfortune is, that it is impossible for people to get on in the world
in any tolerable way without mutual confidence. However, let us drop
this subject: there is no need that we should be evermore preaching. Go
on.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I determined then to quit that service, though it seemed so good
a one, and to choose another, in which well-doing, if not rewarded, was
at least not punished. I went back to Seville, and entered the service
of a very rich merchant.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> How did you set about getting yourself a master? As things are
now-a-days, an honest man has great difficulty in finding an employer.
Very different are the lords of the earth from the Lord of Heaven; the
former, before they will accept a servant, first scrutinise his birth
and parentage, examine into his qualifications, and even require to know
what clothes he has got; but for entering the service of God, the
poorest is the richest, the humblest is the best born; and whoso is but
disposed to serve him in purity of heart is at once entered in his book
of wages, and has such assigned to him as his utmost desire can hardly
compass, so ample are they.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> All this is preaching, Scipio.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Well, it strikes me that it is. So go on.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> With respect to your question, how I set about getting a master:
you are aware that humility is the base and foundation of all virtues,
and that without it there are none. It smooths inconveniences, overcomes
difficulties, and is a means which always conducts us to glorious ends;
it makes friends of enemies, tempers the wrath of the choleric, and
abates the arrogance of the proud: it is the mother of modesty, and
sister of temperance. I availed myself of this virtue whenever I wanted
to get a place in any house, after having first considered and carefully
ascertained that it was one which could maintain a great dog. I then
placed myself near the door; and whenever any one entered whom I guessed
to be a stranger, I barked at him; and when the master entered, I went
up to him with my head down, my tail wagging, and licked his shoes. If
they drove me out with sticks, I took it patiently, and turned with the
same gentleness to fawn in the same way on the person who beat me. The
rest let me alone, seeing my perseverance and my generous behaviour; and
after one or two turns of this kind, I got a footing in the house. I was
a good servant: they took a liking to me immediately; and I was never
turned out, but dismissed myself, or, to speak more properly, I ran
away; and sometimes I met with such a master, that but for the
persecution of fortune I should have remained with him to this day.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> It was just in the same way that I got into the houses of the
masters I served. It seems that we read men's thoughts.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I will tell you now what happened to me after I left the fold in
the power of those reprobates. I returned, as I have said, to Seville,
the asylum of the poor and refuge for the destitute, which embraces in
its greatness not only the rude but the mighty and nourishing. I planted
myself at the door of a large house belonging to a merchant, exerted
myself as usual, and after a few trials gained admission. They kept me
tied up behind the door by day, and let me loose at night. I did my duty
with great care and diligence, barked at strangers, and growled at
those who were not well known. I did not sleep at night, but visited the
yards, and walked about the terraces, acting as general guard over our
own house and those of the neighbours; and my master was so pleased with
my good service, that he gave orders I should be well treated, and have
a ration of bread, with the bones from his table, and the kitchen
scraps. For this I showed my gratitude by no end of leaps when I saw my
master, especially when he came home after being abroad; and such were
my demonstrations of joy that my master ordered me to be untied, and
left loose day and night. As soon as I was set free, I ran to him, and
gambolled all round him, without venturing to lay my paws on him; for I
bethought me of that ass in Æsop's Fables, who was ass enough to think
of fondling his master in the same manner as his favourite lap-dog, and
was well basted for his pains. I understood that fable to signify, that
what is graceful and comely in some is not so in others. Let the ribald
flout and jeer, the mountebank tumble,—let the common fellow, who has
made it his business, imitate the song of birds and the gestures of
animals, but not the man of quality, who can deserve no credit or renown
from any skill in these things.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Enough said, Berganza; I understand you; go on.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Would that others for whom I say this understood me as well! For
there is something or other in my nature which makes me feel greatly
shocked when I see a cavalier make a buffoon of himself, and taking
pride in being able to play at thimblerig, and in dancing the <i>chacona</i>
to perfection, I know a cavalier who boasted, that he had, at the
request of a sacristan, cut out thirty-two paper ornaments, to stick
upon the black cloth over a monument; and he was so proud of his
performance that he took his friends to see it, as though he were
showing them pennons and trophies taken from the enemy, and hung over
the tombs of his forefathers. Well, this merchant I have been telling
you of had two sons, one aged twelve, the other about fourteen, who were
studying the humanities in the classes of the Company of Jesus. They
went in pomp to the college, accompanied by their tutor, and by pages to
carry their books, and what they called their Vademecum. To see them go
with such parade, on horseback in fine weather, and in a carriage when
it rained, made me wonder at the plain manner in which their father
went abroad upon his business, attended by no other servant than a
negro, and sometimes mounted upon a sorry mule.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> You must know, Berganza, that it is a customary thing with the
merchants of Seville, and of other cities also, to display their wealth
and importance, not in their own persons, but in those of their sons:
for merchants are greater in their shadows than in themselves; and as
they rarely attend to anything else than their bargains, they spend
little on themselves; but as ambition and wealth burn to display
themselves, they show their own in the persons of their sons,
maintaining them as sumptuously as if they were sons of princes.
Sometimes too they purchase titles for them, and set upon their breasts
the mark that so much distinguishes men of rank from the commonalty.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> It is ambition, but a generous ambition that seeks to improve
one's condition without prejudice to others.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Seldom or never can ambition consist with abstinence from injury
to others.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Have we not said that we are not to speak evil of any one?</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Ay, but I don't speak evil of any one.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> You now convince me of the truth of what I have often heard say,
that a person of a malicious tongue will utter enough to blast ten
families, and calumniate twenty good men; and if he is taken to task for
it, he will reply that he said nothing; or, if he did, he meant nothing
by it, and would not have said it if he had thought any one would take
it amiss. In truth, Scipio, one had need of much wisdom and wariness to
be able to entertain a conversation for two hours, without approaching
the confines of evil speaking. In my own case, for instance, brute as I
am, I see that with every fourth phrase I utter, words full of malice
and detraction come to my tongue like flies to wine. I therefore say
again that doing and speaking evil are things we inherit from our first
parents, and suck in with our mother's milk. This is manifest in the
fact, that hardly is a boy out of swaddling clothes before he lifts his
hand to take vengeance upon those by whom he thinks himself offended;
and the first words he articulates are to call his nurse or his mother a
jade.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> That is true. I confess my error, and beg you will forgive it,
as I have forgiven you so many. Let us pitch ill-nature into the sea—as
the boys say—and henceforth backbite no more. Go on with your story.
You were talking of the grand style in which the sons of your master the
merchant went to the college of the Company of Jesus.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I will go on then; and though I hold it a sufficient thing to
abstain from ill-natured remarks, yet I propose to use a remedy, which I
am told was employed by a great swearer, who repenting of his bad habit,
made it a practice to pinch his arm, or kiss the ground as penance,
whenever an oath escaped him; but he continued to swear for all that. In
like manner, whenever I act contrary to the precept you have given me
against evil speaking, and contrary to my own intention to abstain from
that practice, I will bite the tip of my tongue, so that the smart may
remind me of my fault, and hinder me from relapsing into it.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> If that is the remedy you mean to use, I expect that you will
have to bite your tongue so often, that there will be none of it left,
and it will be put beyond the possibility of offending.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> At least I will do my best; may heaven make up my deficiencies.
Well, to resume: one day my master's sons left a note-book in the
court-yard where I was; and as I had been taught to fetch and carry, I
took it up, and went after them, resolved to put it into their own
hands. It turned out exactly as I desired; for my masters seeing me
coming with the note-book in my mouth, which I held cleverly by its
string, sent a page to take it from me; but I would not let him, nor
quitted it till I entered the hall with it, at which all the students
fell a laughing. Going up to the elder of my masters, I put it into his
hands, with all the obsequiousness I could, and went and seated myself
on my haunches at the door of the hall, with my eyes fixed on the master
who was lecturing in the chair. There is some strange charm in virtue;
for though I know little or nothing about it, I at once took delight in
seeing the loving care and industry with which the reverend fathers
taught those youths, shaping their tender minds aright, and guiding them
in the path of virtue, which they demonstrated to them along with
letters. I observed how they reproved them with suavity, chastised them
with mercy, animated them with examples, incited them with rewards, and
indulged them with prudence; and how they set before them the
loathsomeness of vice and the beauty of virtue, so that abhorring the
one and loving the other, they might achieve the end for which they were
created.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> You say very well, Berganza; for I have heard tell of this holy
fraternity, that for worldly wisdom there are none equal to them; and
that as guides and leaders on the road to heaven, few come up to them.
They are mirrors of integrity, catholic doctrine, rare wisdom, and
profound humility, the base on which is erected the whole edifice of
beatitude.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> That is every word true. But to return to my story: my masters
were so pleased with my carrying them the note-book, that they would
have me do so every day; and thus I enjoyed the life of a king, or even
better, having nothing to do but to play with the students, with whom I
grew so tame, that they would put their hands in my mouth, and the
smallest of them would ride on my back. They would fling their hats or
caps for me to fetch, and I would put them into their hands with marks
of great delight. They used to give me as much to eat as they could; and
they were fond of seeing, when they gave me nuts or almonds, how I
cracked them like a monkey, let fall the shells, and ate the kernels.
One student, to make proof of my ability, brought me a great quantity of
salad in a basket, and I ate it like a human being. It was the winter
season, when manchets and mantequillas abound in Seville; and I was so
well supplied with them, that many an Antonio was pawned or sold that I
might breakfast. In short, I spent a student's life, without hunger or
itch, and that is saying everything for it; for if hunger and itch were
not identified with the student's life, there would be none more
agreeable in the world; since virtue and pleasure go hand in hand
through it, and it is passed in learning and taking diversion. This
happy life ended too soon for me. It appeared to the professors that the
students spent the half-hour between the classes not in studying their
lessons, but in playing with me; and therefore they ordered my masters
not to bring me any more to the college. I was left at home accordingly,
at my old post behind the door; and notwithstanding the order graciously
given by the head of the family, that I should be at liberty day and
night, I was again confined to a small mat, with a chain round my neck.
Ah, friend Scipio, did you but know how sore a thing it is to pass from
a state of happiness to one of wretchedness! When sorrows and distresses
flood the whole course of life, either they soon end in death, or their
continuance begets a habit of endurance, which generally alleviates
their greatest rigour; but when one passes suddenly and unexpectedly
from a miserable and calamitous lot to one of prosperity and enjoyment,
and soon after relapses into his former state of woe and suffering: this
is such a poignant affliction, that if it does not extinguish life, it
is only to make it a prolonged torment. Well, I returned to my ordinary
rations, and to the bones which were flung to me by a negress belonging
to the house; but even these were partly filched from me by two cats,
who very nimbly snapped up whatever fell beyond the range of my chain.
Brother Scipio, as you hope that heaven will prosper all your desires,
do suffer me to philosophise a little at present; for unless I utter the
reflections which have now occurred to my mind, I feel that my story
will not be complete or duly edifying.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Beware, Berganza, that this inclination to philosophise is not a
temptation of the fiend; for slander has no better cloak to conceal its
malice than the pretence that all it utters are maxims of philosophers,
that evil speaking is moral reproval, and the exposure of the faults of
others is nothing but honest zeal. There is no sarcastic person whose
life, if you scrutinise it closely, will not be found full of vices and
improprieties. And now, after this warning, philosophise as much as you
have a mind.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> You may be quite at your ease on that score, Scipio. What I have
to remark is, that as I was the whole day at leisure—and leisure is the
mother of reflection—I conned over several of those Latin phrases I had
heard when I was with my masters at college, and wherewith it seemed to
me that I had somewhat improved my mind; and I determined to make use of
them as occasion should arise, as if I knew how to talk, but in a
different manner from that practised by some ignorant persons, who
interlard their conversation with Latin apophthegms, giving those who do
not understand them to believe that they are great Latinists, whereas
they can hardly decline a noun or conjugate a verb.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> That is not so bad as what is done by some who really
understand Latin; some of whom are so absurd, that in talking with a
shoemaker or a tailor, they pour out Latin like water.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> On the whole we may conclude, that he who talks Latin before
persons who do not understand it, and he who talks it, being himself
ignorant of it, are both equally to blame.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Another thing you may remark, which is that some persons who
know Latin are not the less asses for all that.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> No doubt of it; and the reason is clear; for when in the time of
the Romans everybody spoke Latin as his mother tongue, that did not
hinder some among them from being boobies.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> But to know when to keep silence in the mother tongue, and speak
in Latin, is a thing that needs discretion, brother Berganza.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> True; for a foolish word may be spoken in Latin as well as in
the vulgar tongue; and I have seen silly literati, tedious pedants, and
babblers in the vernacular, who were enough to plague one to death with
their scraps of Latin.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> No more of this: proceed to your philosophical remarks.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> They are already delivered.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> How so?</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> In those remarks on Latin and the vulgar tongue, which I began
and you finished.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Do you call railing philosophising? Sanctify the unhallowed
plague of evil speaking, Berganza, and give it any name you please, it
will, nevertheless entail upon us the name of cynics, which means dogs
of ill tongue. In God's name, hold your peace, and go on with your
story.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> How can I go on with my story, if I hold my peace?</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> I mean go on with it in one piece, and don't hang on so many
tails to it as to make it look like a polypus.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Speak correctly, Scipio: one does not say the tails but the arms
of a polypus. But to my story: my evil fortune, not content with having
torn me from my studies, and from the calm and joyous life I led amid
them; not content with having fastened me up behind a door, and
transferred me from the liberality of the students to the stinginess of
the negress, resolved to rob me of the little ease and comfort I still
enjoyed. Look ye, Scipio, you may set it down with me for a certain
fact, that ill luck will hunt out and find the unlucky one, though he
hides in the uttermost parts of the earth. I have reason to say this;
for the negress was in love with a negro, also belonging to the house,
who slept in the porch between the street-door and the inner one behind
which I was fastened, and they could only meet at night, to which end
they had stolen the keys or got false ones. Every night the negress came
down stairs, and stopping my mouth with a piece of meat or cheese,
opened the door for the negro. For some days, the woman's bribes kept my
conscience asleep; for but for them, I began to fear that my ribs would
come together, and that I should be changed from a mastiff to a
greyhound. But my better nature coming at last to my aid, I bethought me
of what was due to my master, whose bread I ate; and that I ought to act
as becomes not only honest dogs, but all who have masters to serve.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> There now, Berganza, you have spoken what I call true
philosophy; but go on. Do not make too long a yarn—not to say tail of
your history.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> But, first of all, pray tell me if you know what is the meaning
of the word philosophy? For though I use it, I do not know what the
thing really is, only I guess that it is something good.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> I will tell you briefly. The word is compounded of two Greek
words, <i>philo</i>, love, and <i>sophia</i>, wisdom; so that it means love of
wisdom, and philosopher a lover of wisdom.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> What a deal you know, Scipio. Who the deuce taught you Greek
words?</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Truly you are a simpleton, Berganza, to make so much of a matter
that is known to every schoolboy; indeed, there are many persons who
pretend to know Greek, though they are ignorant of it, just as is the
case with Latin.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I believe it, Scipio; and I would have such persons put under a
press, as the Portuguese do with the negroes of Guinea, and have all the
juice of their knowledge well squeezed out of them, so that they might
no more cheat the world with their scraps of broken Greek and Latin.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Now indeed, Berganza, you may bite your tongue, and I may do
the same; for we do nothing but rail in every word.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Ay, but I am not bound to do as I have heard that one Charondas,
a Tyrian, did, who published a law that no one should enter the national
assembly in arms, on pain of death. Forgetting this, he one day entered
the assembly girt with a sword; the fact was pointed out to him, and, on
the instant, he drew his sword, plunged it into his body, and thus he
was the first who made the law, broke it, and suffered its penalty. But
I made no law; all I did was to promise that I would bite my tongue, if
I chanced to utter an acrimonious word; but things are not so strictly
managed in these times as in those of the ancients. To-day a law is
made, and to-morrow it is broken, and perhaps it is fit it should be so.
To-day a man promises to abandon his fault, and to-morrow he falls into
a greater. It is one thing to extol discipline, and another to inflict
it on one's self; and indeed there is a wide difference between saying
and doing. The devil may bite himself, not I; nor have I a mind to
perform heroic acts of self-denial here on this mat, where there are no
witnesses to commend my honourable determination.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> In that case, Berganza, were you a man you would be a hypocrite,
and all your acts would be fictitious and false, though covered with the
cloak of virtue, and done only that men might praise you, like the acts
of all hypocrites.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I don't know what I should do if I were a man; but what I do
know is that at present I shall not bite my tongue, having so many
things yet to tell, and not knowing how or when I shall be able to
finish them; but rather fearing that when the sun rises we shall be left
groping without the power of speech.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Heaven forbid it! Go on with your story, and do not run off the
road into needless digressions; in that way only you will come soon to
the end of it, however long it may be.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I say, then, that having seen the thievery, impudence, and
shameful conduct of the negroes, I determined, like a good servant, to
put an end to their doings, if possible, and I succeeded completely in
my purpose. The negress, as I have told you, used to come to amuse
herself with the negro, making sure of my silence on account of the
pieces of meat, bread, or cheese she threw me. Gifts have much power,
Scipio.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Much. Don't digress: go on.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I remember, when I was a student, to have heard from the master
a Latin phrase or adage, as they call it, which ran thus: <i>habet bovem
in lingua</i>.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> O confound your Latin! Have you so soon forgotten what we have
said of those who mix up that language with ordinary conversation?</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> But this bit of Latin comes in here quite pat; for you must know
that the Athenians had among their coin one which was stamped with the
figure of an ox; and whenever a judge failed to do justice in
consequence of having been corrupted, they used to say, "He has the ox
on his tongue."</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> I do not see the application.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Is it not very manifest, since I was rendered mute many times by
the negress's gifts, and was careful not to bark when she came down to
meet her amorous negro? Wherefore I repeat, that great is the power of
gifts.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> I have already admitted it; and were it not to avoid too long a
digression, I could adduce many instances in point; but I will speak of
these another time, if heaven grants me an opportunity of narrating my
life to you.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> God grant it! meanwhile I continue. At last my natural integrity
prevailed over the negress's bribes; and one very dark night, when she
came down as usual, I seized her without barking, in order not to alarm
the household; and in a trice I tore her shift all to pieces, and bit a
piece out of her thigh. This little joke confined her for eight days to
her bed, for which she accounted to her masters by some pretended
illness or other. When she was recovered, she came down another night: I
attacked her again; and without biting, scratched her all over as if I
had been carding wool. Our battles were always noiseless, and the
negress always had the worst of them; but she had her revenge. She
stinted my rations and my bones, and those of my own body began to show
themselves through my skin. But though she cut short my victuals, that
did not hinder me from barking; so to make an end of me altogether, she
threw me a sponge fried in grease. I perceived the snare, and knew that
what she offered me was worse than poison, for it would swell up in the
stomach, and never leave it with life. Judging then that it was
impossible for me to guard against the insidious attacks of such a base
enemy, I resolved to get out of her sight, and put some space between
her and me. One day, I found myself at liberty, and without bidding
adieu to any of the family, I went into the street; and before I had
gone a hundred paces, I fell in with the alguazil I mentioned in the
beginning of my story, as being a great friend of my first master
Nicholas the butcher. He instantly knew me, and called me by my name. I
knew him too, and went up to him with my usual ceremonies and caresses.
He took hold of me by the neck, and said to his men, "This is a famous
watch-dog, formerly belonging to a friend of mine: let us bring him
home." The men said, if I was a watch-dog, I should be of great use to
them all, and they wanted to lay hold on me to lead me along; but the
alguazil said, it was not necessary, for I knew him, and would follow
him. I forgot to tell you, that the spiked collar I wore when I ran away
from the flock was stolen from me at an inn by a gipsy, and I went
without one in Seville; but my new master put on me a collar all studded
with brass. Only consider, Scipio, this change in my fortunes, Yesterday
I was a student, and to-day I found myself a bailiff.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> So wags the world, and you need not exaggerate the vicissitudes
of fortune, as if there were any difference between the service of a
butcher and that of a bailiff. I have no patience when I hear some
persons rail at fortune, whose highest hopes never aspired beyond the
life of a stable-boy. How they curse their ill-luck, and all to make the
hearers believe that they have known better days, and have fallen from
some high estate.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Just so. Now you must know that this alguazil was on intimate
terms with an attorney; and the two were connected with a pair of
wenches not a bit better than they ought to be, but quite the reverse.
They were rather good looking, but full of meretricious arts and
impudence. These two served their male associates as baits to fish with.
Their dress and deportment was such that you might recognise them for
what they were at the distance of a musket shot; they frequented the
houses of entertainment for strangers, and the period of the fairs in
Cadiz and Seville was their harvest time, for there was not a Breton
with whom they did not grapple. Whenever a bumpkin fell into their
snares they apprised the alguazil and the attorney to what inn they were
going, and the latter then seized the party as lewd persons, but never
took them to prison, for the strangers always paid money to get out of
the scrape.</p>
<p>One day it happened that Colendres—this was the name of the alguazil's
mistress—picked up a Breton, and made an appointment with him for the
night, whereof she informed her friend; and they were hardly undressed
before the alguazil, the attorney, two bailiffs, and myself entered the
room. The amorous pair were sorely disconcerted, and the alguazil,
inveighing against the enormity of their conduct, ordered them to dress
with all speed, and go with him to prison. The Breton was dismayed, the
attorney interceded from motives of compassion, and prevailed on the
alguazil to commute the penalty for only a hundred reals. The Breton
called for a pair of leather breeches he had laid on a chair at the end
of the room, and in which there was money to pay his ransom, but the
breeches were not to be seen. The fact was, that when I entered the
room, my nostrils were saluted by a delightful odour of ham. I followed
the scent, and found a great piece of ham in one of the pockets of the
breeches, which I carried off into the street, in order to enjoy the
contents without molestation. Having done so, I returned to the house,
where I found the Breton vociferating in his barbarous jargon, and
calling for his breeches, in one of the pockets of which he said he had
fifty gold crowns. The attorney suspected that either Colendres or the
bailiffs had stolen the money; the alguazil was of the same opinion,
took them aside, and questioned them. None of them knew anything, and
they all swore at each other like troopers. Seeing the hubbub, I went
back to the street where I had left the breeches, having no use for the
money in them; but I could not find them, for some one passing by had no
doubt picked them up.</p>
<p>The alguazil, in despair at finding that the Breton had no money to
bribe with, thought to indemnify himself by extorting something from the
mistress of the house. He called for her, and in she came half dressed,
and when she saw and heard the Breton bawling for his money, Colindres
crying in her shift, the alguazil storming, the attorney in a passion,
and the bailiffs ransacking the room, she was in no very good humour.
The alguazil ordered her to put on her clothes and be off with him to
prison, for allowing men and women to meet for bad purposes in her
house. Then indeed the row grew more furious than ever. "Señor Alguazil
and Señor Attorney," said the hostess, "none of your tricks upon me, for
I know a thing or two, I tell you. Give me none of your blustering, but
shut your mouth, and go your ways in God's name, otherwise by my faith
I'll pitch the house out of the windows, and blow upon you all; for I am
well acquainted with the Señora Colendres, and I know moreover that for
many months past she has been kept by the Señor Alguazil; so don't
provoke me to let out any more, but give this gentleman back his money,
and let us all part good friends, for I am a respectable woman, and I
have a husband with his patent of nobility with its leaden seals all
hanging to it, God be thanked! and I carry on this business with the
greatest propriety. I have the table of charges hung up where everybody
may see it, so don't meddle with me, or by the Lord I'll soon settle
your business. It is no affair of mine if women come in with my lodgers;
they have the keys of their rooms, and I am not a lynx to see through
seven walls."</p>
<p>My masters were astounded at the harangue of the landlady, and at
finding how well acquainted she was with the story of their lives; but
seeing there was nobody else from whom they could squeeze money, they
still pretended that they meant to drag her to prison. She appealed to
heaven against the unreasonableness and injustice of their behaving in
that manner when her husband was absent, and he too a man of such
quality. The Breton bellowed for his fifty crowns; the bailiffs
persisted in declaring that they had never set eyes on the breeches, God
forbid! The attorney privately urged the alguazil to search Colindres'
clothes, for he suspected she must have possessed herself of the fifty
crowns, since it was her custom to grope in the pockets of those who
took up with her company. Colindres declared that the Breton was drunk,
and that it was all a lie about his money. All in short was confusion,
oaths, and bawling, and there would have been no end to the uproar if
the lieutenant corregidor had not just then entered the room, having
heard the noise as he was going his rounds. He asked what it was all
about, and the landlady replied with great copiousness of detail. She
told him who was the damsel Colindres (who by this time had got her
clothes on), made known the connection between her and the alguazil, and
exposed her plundering tricks; protested her own innocence, and that it
was never with her consent that a woman of bad repute had entered her
house; cried herself up for a saint, and her husband for a pattern of
excellence; and called out to a servant wench to run and fetch her
husband's patent of nobility out of the chest, that she might show it to
the Señor Lieutenant. He would then be able to judge whether the wife of
so respectable a man was capable of anything but what was quite correct.
If she did keep a lodging-house, it was because she could not help it.
God knows if she would not rather have some comfortable independence to
live upon at her ease. The lieutenant, tired of her volubility and her
bouncing about the patent of gentility, said to her, "Sister hostess, I
am willing to believe that your husband is a gentleman, but then you
must allow he is only a gentleman innkeeper." The landlady replied with
great dignity, "And where is the family in the world, however good its
blood may be, but you may pick some holes in its coat?" "Well, all I
have to say, sister, is, that you must put on your clothes, and come
away to prison." This brought her down from her high flights at once;
she tore her hair, cried, screamed, and prayed, but all in vain; the
inexorable lieutenant carried the whole party off to prison, that is to
say, the Breton, Colindres, and the landlady. I learned afterwards that
the Breton lost his fifty crowns, and was condemned besides to pay
costs; the landlady had to pay as much more. Colindres was let off scot
free, and the very day she was liberated she picked up a sailor, out of
whom she made good her disappointment in the affair of the Breton. Thus
you see, Scipio, what serious troubles arose from my gluttony.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Say rather from the rascality of your master.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Nay but listen, for worse remains to be told, since I am loth to
speak ill of alguazil and attorneys.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Ay, but speaking ill of one is not speaking ill of all. There is
many and many an attorney who is honest and upright. They do not all
take fees from both parties in a suit; nor extort more than their right;
nor go prying about into other people's business in order to entangle
them in the webs of the law; nor league with the justice to fleece one
side and skin the other. It is not every alguazil that is in collusion
with thieves and vagabonds, or keeps a decoy-duck in the shape of a
mistress, as your master did. Very many of them are gentlemen in feeling
and conduct; neither arrogant nor insolent, nor rogues and knaves, like
those who go about inns, measuring the length of strangers' swords, and
ruining their owners if they find them a hair's breadth longer than the
law allows.<a id="FNanchor_60_60"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-6.htm.html#Footnote_60_60" class="pginternal"><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> My master hawked at higher game. He set himself up for a man of
valour, piqued himself on making famous captures, and sustained his
reputation for courage without risk to his person, but at the cost of
his purse. One day at the Puerta de Xeres he fell in, single-handed,
with six famous bravoes, whilst I could not render him any assistance,
having a muzzle on my mouth, which he made me wear by day and took off
at night. I was amazed at his intrepidity and headlong valour. He dashed
in and out between the six swords of the ruffians, and made as light of
them as if they were so many osier wands. It was wonderful to behold the
agility with which he assaulted, his thrusts and parries, and with what
judgment and quickness of eye he prevented his enemies from attacking
him from behind. In short, in my opinion and that of all the spectators
of the fight, he was a very Rhodomont, having fought his men all the way
from the Puerta de Xeres to the statues of the college of Maese Rodrigo,
a good hundred paces and more. Having put them to flight, he returned to
collect the trophies of the battle, consisting of three sheaths, and
these he carried to the corregidor, who was then, if I mistake not, the
licentiate Sarmiento de Valladares, renowned for the destruction of the
Sauceda.<a id="FNanchor_61_61"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-6.htm.html#Footnote_61_61" class="pginternal"><sup>[61]</sup></a> As my master walked through the streets, people pointed to
him and said, "There goes the valiant man who ventured, singly, to
encounter the flower of the bravoes of Andalusia."</p>
<p>He spent the remainder of the day in walking about the city, to let
himself be seen, and at night we went to the suburb of Triana, to a
street near the powder-mill, where my master, looking about to see if
any one observed him, entered a house, myself following him, and in the
court-yard we found the six rogues he had fought with, all untrussed,
and without cloaks or swords. One fellow, who appeared to be the
landlord, had a big jar of wine in one hand and a great tavern goblet in
the other, and, filling a sparkling bumper, he drank to all the company.
No sooner had they set eyes on my master than they all ran to him with
open arms. They all drank his health, and he returned the compliment in
every instance, and would have done it in as many more had there been
occasion—so affable he was and so averse to disoblige any one for
trifles. Were I to recount all that took place there—the supper that
was served up, the fights and the robberies they related, the ladies of
their acquaintance whom they praised or disparaged, the encomiums they
bestowed on each other, the absent bravoes whom they named, the clever
tricks they played, jumping up from supper to exhibit their sleight of
hand, the picked words they used, and, finally, the figure of the host,
whom all respected as their lord and father,—were I to attempt this, I
should entangle myself in a maze, from which I could never extricate
myself. I ascertained that the master of the house, whose name was
Monipodio, was a regular fence, and that my master's battle of the
morning had been preconcerted between him and his opponents, with all
its circumstances, including the dropping of the sword-sheaths, which my
master now delivered, in lieu of his share of the reckoning. The
entertainment was continued almost till breakfast time; and, by way of a
final treat, they gave my master information of a foreign bravo, an
out-and-outer, just arrived in the city. In all probability he was an
abler blade than themselves, and they denounced him from envy. My master
captured him the next night as he lay in bed; but had he been up and
armed, there was that in his face and figure which told me that he would
not have allowed himself to be taken so quietly. This capture, coming
close upon the heels of the pretended fight, enhanced the fame of my
poltroon of a master, who had no more courage than a hare, but sustained
his valorous reputation by treating and feasting; so that all the gains
of his office, both fair and foul, were frittered away upon his false
renown.</p>
<p>I am afraid I weary you, Scipio, but have patience and listen to another
affair that befel him, which I will tell you without a tittle more or
less than the truth. Two thieves stole a fine horse in Antequera,
brought him to Seville, and in order to sell him without risk, adopted
what struck me as being a very ingenious stratagem. They put up at two
different inns, and one of them entered a plaint in the courts of law,
to the effect that Pedro de Losada owed him four hundred reals, money
lent, as appeared by a note of hand, signed by the said Pedro, which he
produced in evidence. The lieutenant corregidor directed that Losada
should be called upon to state whether or not he acknowledged the note
as his own, and if he did, that he should be compelled to pay the amount
by seizure of his goods, or go to prison. My master and his friend the
attorney were employed in this business. One of the thieves took them to
the lodgings of the other, who at once acknowledged his note of hand,
admitted the debt, and offered his horse in satisfaction of the amount.
My master was greatly taken with the animal, and resolved to have it if
it should be sold. The time prescribed by the law being expired, the
horse was put up for sale; my master employed a friend to bid for it,
and it was knocked down to him for five hundred reals, though well worth
twelve or thirteen hundred. Thus one thief obtained payment of the debt
which was not due to him, the other a quittance of which he had no need,
and my master became possessed of the horse, which was as fatal to him
as the famous Sejanus<a id="FNanchor_62_62"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-6.htm.html#Footnote_62_62" class="pginternal"><sup>[62]</sup></a> was to his owners.</p>
<p>The thieves decamped at once; and two days afterwards my master, after
having repaired the horse's trappings, appeared on his back in the Plaza
de San Francisco, as proud and conceited as a bumpkin in his holiday
clothes. Everybody complimented him on his bargain, declaring the horse
was worth a hundred and fifty ducats as surely as an egg was worth a
maravedi. But whilst he was caracolling and curvetting, and showing off
his own person and his horse's paces, two men of good figure and very
well dressed entered the square, one of whom cried out, "Why, bless my
soul! that is my horse Ironfoot, that was stolen from me a few days ago
in Antequera." Four servants, who accompanied him, said the same thing.
My master was greatly chopfallen; the gentleman appealed to justice,
produced his proofs, and they were so satisfactory that sentence was
given in his favour, and my master was dispossessed of the horse. The
imposture was exposed; and it came out how, through the hands of justice
itself, the thieves had sold what they had stolen; and almost everybody
rejoiced that my master's covetousness had made him burn his fingers.</p>
<p>His disasters did not end there. That night the lieutenant going his
rounds, was informed that there were robbers abroad as far as San
Julian's wards. Passing a cross-road he saw a man running away, and
taking me by the collar, "At him, good dog!" he said, "At him, boy!"
Disgusted as I was with my master's villanies, and eager to obey the
lieutenant's orders, I made no hesitation to seize my own master and
pull him down to the ground, where I would have torn him to pieces if
the thief-takers had not with great difficulty separated us. They wanted
to punish me, and even to beat me to death with sticks; and they would
have done so if the lieutenant had not bade them let me alone, for I had
only done what he ordered me. The warning was not lost upon me, so
without taking my leave of anybody, I leaped through an opening in the
wall, and before daybreak I was in Mayrena, a place about four leagues
from Seville.</p>
<p>There by good luck I fell in with a party of soldiers, who, as I heard,
were going to embark at Cartagena. Among them were four of my late
master's ruffian friends; one of them was the drummer, who had been a
catchpole and a great buffoon, as drummers frequently are. They all knew
me and spoke to me, asking after my master as if I could reply; but the
one who showed the greatest liking for me was the drummer, and so I
determined to attach myself to him, if he would let me, and to accompany
the expedition whether they were bound for Italy or Flanders. For in
spite of the proverb, a blockhead at home is a blockhead all the world
over, you must agree with me that travelling and sojourning among
various people makes men wise.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> That is so true that I remember to have heard from a master of
mine, a very clever man, that the famous Greek, Ulysses, was renowned as
wise solely because he had travelled and seen many men and nations. I
therefore applaud your determination to go with the soldiers, wherever
they might take you.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> To help him in the display of his jugglery, the drummer began to
teach me to dance to the sound of the drum, and to play other monkey
tricks such as no other dog than myself could ever have acquired. The
detachment marched by very short stages; we had no commissary to control
us; the captain was a mere lad, but a perfect gentleman, and a great
christian; the ensign had but just left the page's hall at the court;
the serjeant was a knowing blade, and a great conductor of companies
from the place where they were raised to the port of embarkation. The
detachment was full of ruffians whose insolent behaviour, in the places
through which we passed, redounded in curses directed to a quarter where
they were not deserved. It is the misfortune of the good prince to be
blamed by some of his subjects, for faults committed by others of them,
which he could not remedy if he would, for the circumstances attendant
on war are for the most part inevitably harsh, oppressive, and untoward.</p>
<p>In the course of a fortnight, what with my own cleverness, and the
diligence of him I had chosen for my patron, I learned to jump for the
king of France, and not to jump for the good-for-nothing landlady; he
taught me to curvet like a Neapolitan courser, to move in a ring like a
mill horse, and other things which might have made one suspect that they
were performed by a demon in the shape of a dog. The drummer gave me the
name of the wise dog, and no sooner were we arrived at a halting place,
than he went about, beating his drum, and giving notice to all who
desired to behold the marvellous graces and performances of the wise
dog, that they were to be seen at such a house, for four or eight
maravedis a head, according to the greater or less wealth of the place.
After these encomiums everybody ran to see me, and no one went away
without wonder and delight. My master exulted in the gains I brought
him, which enabled him to maintain six of his comrades like princes. The
envy and covetousness of the rogues was excited, and they were always
watching for an opportunity to steal me, for any way of making money by
sport has great charms for many. This is why there are so many puppet
showmen in Spain, so many who go about with peep shows, so many others
who hawk pens and ballads, though their stock, if they sold it all,
would not be enough to keep them for a day; and yet they are to be found
in taverns and drinking-shops all the year round, whence I infer that
the cost of their guzzling is defrayed by other means than the profits
of their business. They are all good-for-nothing vagabonds, bread
weevils and winesponges.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> No more of that, Berganza; let us not go over the same ground
again. Continue your story, for the night is waning, and I should not
like, when the sun rises, that we should be left in the shades of
silence.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Keep it and listen. As it is an easy thing to extend and improve
our inventions, my master, seeing how well I imitated a Neapolitan
courser, made me housings of gilt leather, and a little saddle, which he
fitted on my back; he put on it a little figure of a man, with lance in
hand, and taught me to run straight at a ring fixed between two stakes.
As soon as I was perfect in that performance, my master announced that
on that day the wise dog would run at the ring, and exhibit other new
and incomparable feats, which, indeed, I drew from my own invention, not
to give my master the lie. We next marched to Montilla, a town belonging
to the famous and great christian, Marquis of Priego, head of the house
of Aguilar and Montilla. My master was quartered, at his own request, in
a hospital; he made his usual proclamation, and as my great fame had
already reached the town, the court-yard was filled with spectators in
less than an hour. My master rejoiced to see such a plenteous harvest,
and resolved to show himself that day a first-rate conjuror. The
entertainment began with my leaping through a hoop. He had a willow
switch in his hand, and when he lowered it, that was a signal for me to
leap; and when he kept it raised, I was not to budge.</p>
<p>On that day (for ever memorable in my life) he began by saying, "Come,
my friend, jump for that juvenile old gentleman, you know, who blacks
his beard; or, if you won't, jump for the pomp and grandeur of Donna
Pimpinela de Plafagonia, who was the fellow servant of the Galician
kitchen wench at Valdeastillas. Don't you like that, my boy? Then jump
for the bachelor Pasillas, who signs himself licentiate without having
any degree. How lazy you are! Why don't you jump? Oh! I understand! I
am up to your roguery! Jump, then, for the wine of Esquivias, a match
for that of Ciudad Real, St. Martin, and Rivadavia." He lowered the
switch, and I jumped in accordance with the signal. Then, addressing the
audience, "Do not imagine, worshipful senate," he said, "that it is any
laughing matter what this dog knows. I have taught him four-and-twenty
performances, the least of which is worth going thirty leagues to see.
He can dance the zaraband and the chacona better than their inventor; he
tosses off a pint of wine without spilling a drop; he intones a sol, fa,
mi, re, as well as any sacristan. All these things, and many others
which remain to be told, your worships shall witness during the time the
company remains here. At present, our wise one will give another jump,
and then we will enter upon the main business."</p>
<p>Having inflamed the curiosity of the audience, or senate, as he called
them, with this harangue, he turned to me and said, "Come now, my lad,
and go through all your jumps with your usual grace and agility; but
this time it shall be for the sake of the famous witch who is said to
belong to this place." The words were hardly out of his mouth, when the
matron of the hospital, an old woman, who seemed upwards of seventy,
screamed out, "Rogue, charlatan, swindler, there is no witch here. If
you mean Camacha, she has paid the penalty of her sin, and is where God
only knows; if you mean me, you juggling cheat, I am no witch, and never
was one in my life; and if I ever was reputed to be a witch, I may thank
false witnesses, and the injustice of the law, and a presumptuous and
ignorant judge. All the world knows the life of penance I lead, not for
any acts of witchcraft, which I have never done, but for other great
sins which I have committed as a poor sinner. So get out of the
hospital, you rascally sheep-skin thumper, or by all the saints I'll
make you glad to quit it at a run." And with that she began to screech
at such a rate, and pour such a furious torrent of abuse upon my master,
that he was utterly confounded. In fine, she would not allow the
entertainment to proceed on any account. My master did not care much
about the row, as he had his money in his pocket, and he announced that
he would give the performance next day in another hospital. The people
went away cursing the old woman, and calling her a witch, and a bearded
hag into the bargain. We remained for all that in the hospital that
night, and the old woman meeting me alone in the yard, said, "Is that
you, Montiel, my son? Is that you?" I looked up as she spoke, and gazed
steadily at her, seeing which, she came to me with tears in her eyes,
threw her arms round my neck, and would have kissed my mouth if I had
allowed her; but I was disgusted, and would not endure it.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> You were quite right, for it is no treat, but quite the reverse,
to kiss or be kissed by an old woman.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> What I am now going to relate I should have told you at the
beginning of my story, as it would have served to diminish the surprise
we felt at finding ourselves endowed with speech. Said the old woman to
me, "Follow me, Montiel, my son, that you may know my room; and be sure
you come to me to-night, that we may be alone together, for I have many
things to tell you of great importance for you to know." I drooped my
head in token of obedience, which confirmed her in her belief that I was
the dog Montiel whom she had been long looking for, as she afterwards
told me. I remained bewildered with surprise, longing for the night to
see what might be the meaning of this mystery or prodigy, and as I had
heard her called a witch, I expected wonderful things from the
interview. At last the time came, and I entered the room, which was
small, and low, and dimly lighted by an earthenware lamp. The old woman
trimmed it, sat down on a chest, drew me to her, and without speaking a
word, fell to embracing me, and I to taking care that she did not kiss
me.</p>
<p>"I did always hope in heaven," the old woman began, "that I should see
my son before my eyes were closed in the last sleep; and now that I have
seen you, let death come when it will, and release me from this life of
sorrow. You must know, my son, that there lived in this city the most
famous witch in the world, called Camacha de Montilla. She was so
perfect in her art, that the Erichtheas, Circes, and Medeas, of whom old
histories, I am told, are full, were not to be compared to her. She
congealed the clouds when she pleased, and covered the face of the sun
with them; and when the whim seized her, she made the murkiest sky clear
up at once. She fetched men in an instant from remote lands; admirably
relieved the distresses of damsels who had forgot themselves for a
moment; enabled widows to console themselves without loss of reputation;
unmarried wives, and married those she pleased. She had roses in her
garden in December, and gathered wheat in January. To make watercresses
grow in a handbasin was a trifle to her, or to show any persons whom you
wanted to see, either dead or alive, in a looking-glass, or on the nail
of a newborn infant. It was reported that she turned men into brutes,
and that she made an ass of a sacristan, and used him really and truly
in that form for six years. I never could make out how this was done;
for as for what is related of those ancient sorceresses, that they
turned men into beasts, the learned are of opinion that this means only
that by their great beauty and their fascinations, they so captivated
men and subjected them to their humours, as to make them seem
unreasoning animals. But in you, my son, I have a living instance to the
contrary, for I know that you are a rational being, and I see you in the
form of a dog; unless indeed this is done through that art which they
call Tropelia, which makes people mistake appearances and take one thing
for another.</p>
<p>"Be this as it may, what mortifies me is that neither your mother nor
myself, who were disciples of the great Camacha, ever came to know as
much as she did, and that not for want of capacity, but through her
inordinate selfishness, which could never endure that we should learn
the higher mysteries of her art, and be as wise as herself. Your mother,
my son, was called Montiela, and next to Camacha, she was the most
famous of witches. My name is Cañizares; and, if not equal in
proficiency to either of these two, at least I do not yield to them in
good will to the art. It is true that in boldness of spirit, in the
intrepidity with which she entered a circle, and remained enclosed in it
with a legion of fiends, your mother was in no wise inferior to Camacha
herself; while, for my part, I was always somewhat timid, and contented
myself with conjuring half a legion; but though I say it that should
not, in the matter of compounding witches' ointment, I would not turn my
back upon either of them, no, nor upon any living who follow our rules.
But you must know, my son, ever since I have felt how fast my life is
hastening away upon the light wings of time, I have sought to withdraw
from all the wickedness of witchcraft in which I was plunged for many
years, and I have only amused myself with white magic, a practice so
engaging that it is most difficult to forego it. Your mother acted in
the same manner; she abandoned many evil practices, and performed many
righteous works; but she would not relinquish white magic to the hour of
her death. She had no malady, but died by the sorrow brought upon her by
her mistress, Camacha, who hated her because she saw that in a short
time Montiela would know as much as herself, unless indeed she had some
other cause of jealousy not known to me.</p>
<p>"Your mother was pregnant, and her time being come, Camacha was her
midwife. She received in her hands what your mother brought forth, and
showed her that she had borne two puppy dogs. 'This is a bad business,'
said Camacha; 'there is some knavery here. But, sister Montiela, I am
your friend, and I will conceal this unfortunate birth; so have patience
and get well, and be assured that your misfortune shall remain an
inviolable secret.' I was present at this extraordinary occurrence, and
was not less astounded than your mother. Camacha went away taking the
whelps with her, and I remained to comfort the lying-in woman, who could
not bring herself to believe what had happened. At last Camacha's end
drew near, and when she felt herself at the point of death, she sent for
her and told her how she had turned her sons into dogs on account of a
certain grudge she bore her, but that she need not distress herself, for
they would return to their natural forms when it was least expected; but
this would not happen 'until they shall see the exalted quickly brought
low, and the lowly exalted by an arm that is mighty to do it.'</p>
<p>"Your mother wrote down this prophecy, and deeply engraved it in her
memory, and so did I, that I might impart it to one of you if ever the
opportunity should present itself. And in hopes to recognise you, I have
made it a practice to call every dog of your colour by your mother's
name, to see if any of them would answer to one so unlike those usually
given to dogs; and, this evening, when I saw you do so many things, and
they called you the wise dog, and also when you looked up at me upon my
calling to you in the yard, I believed that you were really the son of
Montiela. It is with extreme pleasure I acquaint you with the history
of your birth, and the manner in which you are to recover your original
form. I wish it was as easy as it was for the golden ass of Apuleius,
who had only to eat a rose for his restoration; but yours depends upon
the actions of others, and not upon your own efforts. What you have to
do meanwhile, my son, is to commend yourself heartily to God, and hope
for the speedy and prosperous fulfilment of the prophecy; for since it
was pronounced by Camacha it will be accomplished without any doubt, and
you and your brother, if he is alive, will see yourselves as you would
wish to be. All that grieves me is that I am so near my end, that I can
have no hope of witnessing the joyful event.</p>
<p>"I have often longed to ask my goat how matters would turn out with you
at last; but I had not the courage to do so, for he never gives a
straightforward answer, but as crooked and perplexing as possible. That
is always the way with our lord and master; there is no use in asking
him anything, for with one truth he mingles a thousand lies, and from
what I have noted of his replies it appears that he knows nothing for
certain of the future, but only by way of conjecture. At the same time
he so be-fools us that, in spite of a thousand treacherous tricks he
plays us, we cannot shake off his influence. We go to see him a long way
from here in a great field, where we meet a multitude of warlocks and
witches, and are feasted without measure, and other things take place
which, indeed and in truth, I cannot bring myself to mention, nor will I
offend your chaste ears by repeating things so filthy and abominable.
Many are of opinion that we frequent these assemblies only in
imagination, wherein the demon presents to us the images of all those
things which we afterwards relate as having occurred to us in reality;
others, on the contrary, believe that we actually go to them in body and
soul; and for my part I believe that both opinions are true, since we
know not when we go in the one manner or in the other; for all that
happens to us in imagination does so with such intensity, that it is
impossible to distinguish between it and reality. Their worships the
inquisitors have had sundry opportunities of investigating this matter,
in the cases of some of us whom they have had under their hands, and I
believe that they have ascertained the truth of what I state.</p>
<p>"I should like, my son, to shake off this sin, and I have exerted
myself to that end. I have got myself appointed matron to this hospital;
I tend the poor, and some die who afford me a livelihood either by what
they leave me, or by what I find among their rags, through the great
care I always take to examine them well. I say but few prayers, and only
in public, but grumble a good deal in secret. It is better for me to be
a hypocrite than an open sinner; for my present good works efface from
the memory of those who know me the bad ones of my past life. After all,
pretended sanctity injures no one but the person who practises it. Look
you, Montiel, my son, my advice to you is this: be good all you can; but
if you must be wicked, contrive all you can not to appear so. I am a
witch, I do not deny it, and your mother was one likewise; but the
appearances we put on were always enough to maintain our credit in the
eyes of the whole world. Three days before she died, we were both
present at a grand sabbath of witches in a valley of the Pyrenees; and
yet when she died it was with such calmness and serenity, that were it
not for some grimaces she made a quarter of an hour before she gave up
the ghost, you would have thought she lay upon a bed of flowers. But her
two children lay heavy at her heart, and even to her last gasp she never
would forgive Camacha, such a resolute spirit she had. I closed her eyes
and followed her to the grave, and there took my last look at her;
though, indeed, I have not lost the hope of seeing her again before I
die, for they say that several persons have met her going about the
churchyards and the cross-roads in various forms, and who knows but I
may fall in with her some time or other, and be able to ask her whether
I can do anything for the relief of her conscience?"</p>
<p>Every word that the old hag uttered in praise of her she called my
mother went like a knife to my heart; I longed to fall upon her and tear
her to pieces, and only refrained from unwillingness that death should
find her in such a wicked state. Finally she told me that she intended
to anoint herself that night and go to one of their customary
assemblies, and inquire of her master as to what was yet to befal me. I
should have liked to ask her what were the ointments she made use of;
and it seemed as though she read my thoughts, for she replied to my
question as though it had been uttered.</p>
<p>"This ointment," she said, "is composed of the juices of exceedingly
cold herbs, and not, as the vulgar assert, of the blood of children whom
we strangle. And here you may be inclined to ask what pleasure or profit
can it be to the devil to make us murder little innocents, since he
knows that being baptised they go as sinless creatures to heaven, and
every Christian soul that escapes him is to him a source of poignant
anguish. I know not what answer to give to this except by quoting the
old saying, that some people would give both their eyes to make their
enemy lose one. He may do it for sake of the grief beyond imagination
which the parents suffer from the murder of their children; but what is
still more important to him is to accustom us to the repeated commission
of such a cruel and perverse sin. And all this God allows by reason of
our sinfulness; for without his permission, as I know by experience, the
devil has not the power to hurt a pismire; and so true is this, that one
day when I requested him to destroy a vineyard belonging to an enemy of
mine, he told me that he could not hurt a leaf of it, for God would not
allow him. Hence you may understand when you come to be a man, that all
the casual evils that befal men, kingdoms, and cities, and peoples,
sudden deaths, shipwrecks, devastations, and all sorts of losses and
disasters, come from the hand of the Almighty, and by his sovereign
permission; and the evils which fall under the denomination of crime,
are caused by ourselves. God is without sin, whence it follows that we
ourselves are the authors of sin, forming it in thought, word, and deed;
God permitting all this by reason of our sinfulness, as I have already
said.</p>
<p>"Possibly you will ask, my son, if so be you understand me, who made me
a theologian? And mayhap you will say to yourself, Confound the old hag!
why does not she leave off being a witch since she knows so much? Why
does not she turn to God, since she knows that he is readier to forgive
sin than to permit it? To this I reply, as though you had put the
question to me, that the habit of sinning becomes a second nature, and
that of being a witch transforms itself into flesh and blood; and amidst
all its ardour, which is great, it brings with it a chilling influence
which so overcomes the soul as to freeze and benumb its faith, whence
follows a forgetfulness of itself, and it remembers neither the terrors
with which God threatens it, nor the glories with which he allures it.
In fact, as sin is fleshly and sensual, it must exhaust and stupefy all
the feelings, and render the soul incapable of rising to embrace any
good thought, or to clasp the hand which God in his mercy continually
holds out to it. I have one of those souls I have described; I see it
clearly; but the empire of the senses enchains my will, and I have ever
been and ever shall be bad.</p>
<p>"But let us quit this subject, and go back to that of our unguents. They
are of so cold a nature that they take away all our senses when we
anoint ourselves with them; we remain stretched on the ground, and then
they say we experience all those things in imagination which we suppose
to occur to us in reality. Sometimes after we have anointed and changed
ourselves into fowls, foals, or deer, we go to the place where our
master awaits us. There we recover our own forms and enjoy pleasures
which I will not describe, for they are such as the memory is ashamed to
recal, and the tongue refuses to relate. The short and the long of it
is, I am a witch, and cover my many delinquencies with the cloak of
hypocrisy. It is true that if some esteem and honour me as a good woman,
there are many who bawl in my ear the name imprinted upon your mother
and me by order of an ill-tempered judge, who committed his wrath to the
hands of the hangman; and the latter, not being bribed, used his plenary
power upon our shoulders. But that is past and gone; and all things
pass, memories wear out, lives do not renew themselves, tongues grow
tired, and new events make their predecessors forgotten. I am matron of
a hospital; my behaviour is plausible in appearance; my unguents procure
me some pleasant moments, and I am not so old but that I may live
another year, my age being seventy-five. I cannot fast on account of my
years, nor pray on account of the swimming in my head, nor go on
pilgrimages for the weakness of my legs, nor give alms because I am
poor, nor think rightly because I am given to back-biting, and to be
able to backbite one must first think evil. I know for all that that God
is good and merciful, and that he knows what is in store for me, and
that is enough; so let us drop this conversation which really makes me
melancholy. Come, my son, and see me anoint myself; for there is a cure
for every sorrow; and though the pleasures which the devil affords us
are illusive and fictitious, yet they appear to us to be pleasures; and
sensual delight is much greater in imagination than in actual fruition,
though it is otherwise with true joys."</p>
<p>After this long harangue she got up, and taking the lamp went into
another and smaller room. I followed her, filled with a thousand
conflicting thoughts, and amazed at what I had heard and what I expected
to see. Cañizares hung the lamp against the wall, hastily stripped
herself to her shift, took a jug from a corner, put her hand into it,
and, muttering between her teeth, anointed herself from her feet to the
crown of her head. Before she had finished she said to me, that whether
her body remained senseless in that room, or whether it quitted it, I
was not to be frightened, nor fail to wait there till morning, when she
would bring me word of what was to befal me until I should be a man. I
signified my assent by drooping my head; and she finished her unction,
and stretched herself on the floor like a corpse. I put my mouth to
hers, and perceived that she did not breathe at all. One thing I must
own to you, friend Scipio, that I was terribly frightened at seeing
myself shut up in that narrow room with that figure before me, which I
will describe to you as well as I can.</p>
<p>She was more than six feet high, a mere skeleton covered with a black
wrinkled skin. Her dugs were like two dried and puckered ox-bladders;
her lips were blackened; her long teeth locked together; her nose was
hooked; her eyes starting from her head; her hair hung in elf-locks on
her hollow wrinkled cheeks;—in short, she was all over diabolically
hideous. I remained gazing on her for a while, and felt myself overcome
with horror as I contemplated the hideous spectacle of her body, and the
worse occupation of her soul. I wanted to bite her to see if she would
come to herself, but I could not find a spot on her whole body that did
not fill me with disgust. Nevertheless, I seized her by one heel, and
dragged her to the yard, without her ever giving any sign of feeling.
There seeing myself at large with the sky above me, my fear left me, or
at least abated, so much as to give me courage to await the result of
that wicked woman's expedition, and the news she was to bring me.
Meanwhile, I asked myself, how comes this old woman to be at once so
knowing and so wicked? How is it that she can so well distinguish
between casual and culpable evils? How is it that she understands and
speaks so much about God, and acts so much from the prompting of the
devil? How is it that she sins so much from choice, not having the
excuse of ignorance?</p>
<p>In these reflections I passed the night. The day dawned and found us
both in the court, she lying still insensible, and I on my haunches
beside her, attentively watching her hideous countenance. The people of
the hospital came out, and seeing this spectacle, some of them
exclaimed, "The pious Cañizares is dead! See how emaciated she is with
fasting and penance." Others felt her pulse, and finding that she was
not dead, concluded that she was in a trance of holy ecstacy; whilst
others said, "This old hag is unquestionably a witch, and is no doubt
anointed, for saints are never seen in such an indecent condition when
they are lost in religious ecstacy; and among us who know her, she has
hitherto had the reputation of a witch rather than a saint." Some
curious inquirers went so far as to stick pins in her flesh up to the
head, yet without ever awaking her. It was not till seven o'clock that
she came to herself; and then finding how she was stuck over with pins,
bitten in the heels, and her back flayed by being dragged from her room,
and seeing so many eyes intently fixed upon her, she rightly concluded
that I had been the cause of her exposure. "What, you thankless,
ignorant, malicious villain," she cried, "is this my reward for the acts
I did for your mother and those I intended to do for you?" Finding
myself in peril of my life under the talons of that ferocious harpy, I
shook her off, and seizing her by her wrinkled flank, I worried and
dragged her all about the yard, whilst she shrieked for help from the
fangs of that evil spirit. At these words, most present believed that I
must be one of those fiends who are continually at enmity with good
Christians. Some were for sprinkling me with holy water, some were for
pulling me off the old woman, but durst not; others bawled out words to
exorcise me. The witch howled, I tightened my grip with my teeth, the
confusion increased, and my master was in despair, hearing it said that
I was a fiend. A few who knew nothing of exorcisms caught up three or
four sticks and began to baste me. Not liking the joke, I let go the old
woman; in three bounds I was in the street, and in a few more I was
outside the town, pursued by a host of boys, shouting, "Out of the way!
the wise dog is gone mad." Others said "he is not mad, but he is the
devil in the form of a dog." The people of the place were confirmed in
their belief that I was a devil by the tricks they had seen me perform,
by the words spoken by the old woman when she woke out of her infernal
trance, and by the extraordinary speed with which I shot away from them,
so that I seemed to vanish from before them like a being of the other
world. In six hours I cleared twelve leagues; and arrived at a camp of
gipsies in a field near Granada. There I rested awhile, for some of the
gipsies who recognised me as the wise dog, received me with great
delight, and hid me in a cave, that I might not be found if any one came
in search of me; their intention being, as I afterwards learned, to make
money by me as my master the drummer had done. I remained twenty days
among them, during which I observed their habits and ways of life; and
these are so remarkable that I must give you an account of them.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Before you go any further, Berganza, we had better consider what
the witch said to you, and see if there can possibly be a grain of truth
in the great lie to which you give credit. Now, what an enormous
absurdity it would be to believe that Camacha could change human beings
into brutes, or that the sacristan served her for years under the form
of an ass. All these things, and the like, are cheats, lies, or
illusions of the devil; and if it now seems to ourselves that we have
some understanding and reason—since we speak, though we are really dogs
or bear that form—we have already said that this is a portentous and
unparalleled case; and though it is palpably before us, yet we must
suspend our belief until the event determines what it should be. Shall I
make this more plain to you? Consider upon what frivolous things Camacha
declared our restoration to depend, and that what seems a prophecy to
you is nothing but a fable, or one of those old woman's tales, such as
the headless horse, and the wand of virtues, which are told by the
fireside in the long winter nights; for were it anything else it would
already have been accomplished, unless, indeed, it is to be taken in
what I have heard called an allegorical sense: that is to say, a sense
which is not the same as that which the letter imports, but which,
though differing from it, yet resembles it. Now for your
prophecy:—"They are to recover their true forms when they shall see the
exalted quickly brought low, and the lowly exalted by a hand that is
mighty to do it." If we take this in the sense I have mentioned, it
seems to me to mean that we shall recover our forms when we shall see
those who yesterday were at the top of fortune's wheel, to-day cast down
in the mire, and held of little account by those who most esteemed them;
so, likewise, when we shall see others who, but two hours ago, seemed
sent into the world only to figure as units in the sum of its
population, and now are lifted up to the very summit of prosperity. Now,
if our return, as you say, to human form, were to depend on this, why we
have already seen it, and we see it every hour. I infer, then, that
Camacha's words are to be taken, not in an allegorical, but in a
literal, sense; but this will help us out no better, since we have many
times seen what they say, and we are still dogs, as you see. And so
Carnacha was a cheat, Cañizares an artful hag, and Montiela a fool and a
rogue—be it said without offence, if by chance she was the mother of us
both, or yours, for I won't have her for mine. Furthermore, I say that
the true meaning is a game of nine-pins, in which those that stand up
are quickly knocked down, and the fallen are set up again, and that by a
hand that is able to do it. Now think whether or not in the course of
our lives we have ever seen a game of nine-pins, or having seen it, have
therefore been changed into men.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I quite agree with you Scipio, and have a higher opinion of your
judgment than ever. From all you have said, I am come to think and
believe that all that has happened to us hitherto, and that is now
happening, is a dream; but let us not therefore fail to enjoy this
blessing of speech, and the great excellence of holding human discourse
all the time we may; and so let it not weary you to hear me relate what
befel me with the gipsies who hid me in the cave.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> With great pleasure. I will listen to you, that you in your turn
may listen to me, when I relate, if heaven pleases, the events of my
life.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> My occupation among the gipsies was to contemplate their
numberless tricks and frauds, and the thefts they all commit from the
time they are out of leading-strings and can walk alone. You know what a
multitude there is of them dispersed all over Spain. They all know each
other, keep up a constant intelligence among themselves, and
reciprocally pass off and carry away the articles they have purloined.
They render less obedience to their king than to one of their own people
whom they style count, and who bears the surname of Maldonado, as do all
his descendants. This is not because they come of that noble line, but
because a page belonging to a cavalier of that name fell in love with a
beautiful gipsy, who would not yield to his wishes unless he became a
gipsy and made her his wife. The page did so, and was so much liked by
the other gipsies, that they chose him for their lord, yielded him
obedience, and in token of vassalage rendered to him a portion of
everything they stole, whatever it might be.</p>
