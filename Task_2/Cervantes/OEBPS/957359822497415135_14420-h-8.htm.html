<body class="x-ebookmaker x-ebookmaker-2"><p>The gipsies, knowing from Andrew that the youth had a sum of money
about him, readily assented to his accompanying them, and promised to
guard and conceal him as long as he pleased. They determined to make a
bend to the left, and enter La Mancha and the kingdom of Murcia. The
youth thanked them cordially, and gave them on the spot a hundred gold
crowns to divide amongst them, whereupon they became as pliant as washed
leather. Preciosa, however, was not pleased with the continuance among
them of Don Sancho, for that was the youth's name, but the gipsies
changed it to Clement. Andrew too was rather annoyed at this
arrangement; for it seemed to him that Clement had given up his original
intention upon very slight grounds; but the latter, as if he read his
thoughts, told him that he was glad to go to Murcia, because it was near
Carthagena, whence, if galleys arrived there, as he expected, he could
easily pass over to Italy. Finally, in order to have him more under his
own eye, to watch his acts, and scrutinise his thoughts, Andrew desired
to have Clement for his own comrade, and the latter accepted this
friendly offer as a signal favour. They were always together, both spent
largely, their crowns came down like rain; they ran, leaped, danced, and
pitched the bar better than any of their companions, and were more than
commonly liked by the women of the tribe, and held in the highest
respect by the men.</p>
<p>Leaving Estramadura they entered La Mancha, and gradually traversed the
kingdom of Murcia. In all the villages and towns they passed through,
they had matches at ball-playing, fencing, running, leaping, and
pitching the bar; and in all these trials of strength, skill, and
agility Andrew and Clement were victorious, as Andrew alone had been
before. During the whole journey, which occupied six weeks, Clement
neither found nor sought an opportunity to speak alone with Preciosa,
until one day when she and Andrew were conversing together, they called
him to them, and Preciosa said, "The first time you came to our camp I
recognised you, Clement, and remembered the verses you gave me in
Madrid; but I would not say a word, not knowing with what intention you
had come among us. When I became acquainted with your misfortune, it
grieved me to the soul, though at the same time it was a relief to me;
for I had been much disturbed, thinking that as there was a Don Juan in
the world who had become a gipsy, a Don Sancho might undergo
transformation in like manner. I speak this to you, because Andrew tells
me he has made known to you who he is, and with what intention he turned
gipsy." (And so it was, for Andrew had acquainted Clement with his whole
story, that he might be able to converse with him on the subject nearest
to his thoughts.) "Do not think that my knowing you was of little
advantage to you, since for my sake, and in consequence of what I said
of you, our people the more readily admitted you amongst them, where I
trust in God you may find things turn out according to your best wishes.
You will repay me, I hope, for this good will on my part, by not making
Andrew ashamed of having set his mind so low, or representing to him how
ill he does in persevering in his present way of life; for though I
imagine that his will is enthralled to mine, still it would grieve me to
see him show signs, however slight, of repenting what he has done."</p>
<p>"Do not suppose, peerless Preciosa," replied Clement, "that Don Juan
acted lightly in revealing himself to me. I found him out beforehand:
his eyes first disclosed to me the nature of his feelings; I first told
him who I was, and detected that enthralment of his will which you speak
of; and he, reposing a just confidence in me, made his secret mine. He
can witness whether I applauded his determination and his choice; for I
am not so dull of understanding, Preciosa, as not to know how omnipotent
is beauty; and yours, which surpasses all bounds of loveliness, is a
sufficient excuse for all errors, if error that can be called for which
there is so irresistible a cause. I am grateful to you, se√±ora, for what
you have said in my favour; and I hope to repay you by hearty good
wishes that you may find a happy issue out of your perplexities, and
that you may enjoy the love of your Andrew, and Andrew that of his
Preciosa, with the consent of his parents; so that from so beautiful a
couple there may come into the world the finest progeny which nature can
form in her happiest mood. This is what I shall always desire, Preciosa;
and this is what I shall always say to your Andrew, and not anything
which could tend to turn him from his well-placed affections."</p>
<p>With such emotion did Clement utter these words, that Andrew was in
doubt whether they were spoken in courtesy only, or from love; for the
infernal plague of jealousy is so susceptible that it will take offence
at the motes in the sunbeams; and the lover finds matter for
self-torment in everything that concerns the beloved object.
Nevertheless, he did not give way to confirmed jealousy; for he relied
more on the good faith of his Preciosa than on his own fortune, which,
in common with all lovers, he regarded as luckless, so long as he had
not obtained the object of his desires. In fine, Andrew and Clement
continued to be comrades and friends, their mutual good understanding
being secured by Clement's upright intentions, and by the modesty and
prudence of Preciosa, who never gave Andrew an excuse for jealousy.
Clement was somewhat of a poet, Andrew played the guitar a little, and
both were fond of music. One night, when the camp was pitched in a
valley four leagues from Murcia, Andrew seated himself at the foot of a
cork-tree, and Clement near him under an evergreen oak. Each of them had
a guitar; and invited by the stillness of the night, they sang
alternately, Andrew beginning the descant, and Clement responding.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the freeman and the captive were in no haste to
bring their tuneful contest to conclusion, had not the voice of
Preciosa, who had overheard them, sounded from behind in response to
theirs. They stopped instantly, and remained listening to her in
breathless attention. Whether her words were delivered impromptu, or had
been composed some time before, I know not; however that may be, she
sang the following lines with infinite grace, as though they were made

<p>Preciosa having ended her song, Andrew and Clement rose to meet her. An
animated conversation ensued between the three; and Preciosa displayed
so much intelligence, modesty, and acuteness, as fully excused, in
Clement's opinion, the extraordinary determination of Andrew, which he
had before attributed more to his youth than his judgment. The next
morning the camp was broken up, and they proceeded to a place in the
jurisdiction of Murcia, three leagues from the city, where a mischance
befel Andrew, which went near to cost him his life.</p>
<p>After they had given security in that place, according to custom, by
the deposit of some silver vessels and ornaments, Preciosa and her
grandmother, Christina and two other gitanillas, Clement, and Andrew,
took up their quarters in an inn, kept by a rich widow, who had a
daughter aged about seventeen or eighteen, rather more forward than
handsome. Her name was Juana Carducha. This girl having seen the gipsies
dance, the devil possessed her to fall in love with Andrew to that
degree that she proposed to tell him of it, and take him for a husband,
if he would have her, in spite of all her relations. Watching for an
opportunity to speak to him, she found it in a cattle-yard, which Andrew
had entered in search of two young asses, when she said to him,
hurriedly, "Andrew" (she already knew his name), "I am single and
wealthy. My mother has no other child: this inn is her own; and besides
it she has large vineyards, and several other houses. You have taken my
fancy; and if you will have me for a wife, only say the word. Answer me
quickly, and if you are a man of sense, only wait, and you shall see
what a life we shall lead."</p>
<p>Astonished as he was at Carducha's boldness, Andrew nevertheless
answered her with the promptitude she desired, "Se√±ora doncella, I am
under promise to marry, and we gitanos intermarry only with gitanas.
Many thanks for the favour you would confer on me, of which I am not
worthy."</p>
<p>Carducha was within two inches of dropping dead at this unwelcome reply,
to which she would have rejoined, but that she saw some of the gitanos
come into the yard. She rushed from the spot, athirst for vengeance.
Andrew, like a wise man, determined to get out of her way, for he read
in her eyes that she would willingly give herself to him with
matrimonial bonds, and he had no wish to find himself engaged foot to
foot and alone in such an encounter; accordingly, he requested his
comrades to quit the place that night. Complying with his wishes as they
always did, they set to work at once, took up their securities again
that evening, and decamped. Carducha, seeing that Andrew was going away
and half her soul with him, and that she should not have time to obtain
the fulfilment of her desires, resolved to make him stop by force, since
he would not do so of good will. With all the cunning and secrecy
suggested to her by her wicked intentions, she put among Andrew's
baggage, which she knew to be his, a valuable coral necklace, two silver
medals, and other trinkets belonging to her family. No sooner had the
gipsies left the inn than she made a great outcry, declaring that the
gipsies had robbed her, till she brought about her the officers of
justice and all the people of the place. The gipsies halted, and all
swore that they had no stolen property with them, offering at the same
time to let all their baggage be searched. This made the old gipsy woman
very uneasy, lest the proposed scrutiny should lead to the discovery of
Preciosa's trinkets and Andrew's clothes, which she preserved with great
care. But the good wench Carducha quickly put an end to her fears on
that head, for before they had turned over two packages, she said to the
men, "Ask which of these bundles belongs to that gipsy who is such a
great dancer. I saw him enter my room twice, and probably he is the
thief."</p>
<p>Andrew knew it was himself she meant, and answered with a laugh, "Se√±ora
doncella, this is my bundle, and that is my ass. If you find in or upon
either of them what you miss, I will pay you the value sevenfold, beside
submitting to the punishment which the law awards for theft."</p>
<p>The officers of justice immediately unloaded the ass, and in the turn of
a hand discovered the stolen property, whereat Andrew was so shocked and
confounded that he stood like a stone statue. "I was not out in my
suspicions," said Carducha; "see with what a good looking face the rogue
covers his villany." The alcalde, who was present, began to abuse Andrew
and the rest of the gipsies, calling them common thieves and highwaymen.
Andrew said not a word, but stood pondering in the utmost perplexity,
for he had no surmise of Carducha's treachery. At last, an insolent
soldier, nephew to the alcalde, stepped up to him, saying "Look at the
dirty gipsy thief! I will lay a wager he will give himself airs as if he
were an honest man, and deny the robbery, though the goods have been
found in his hands. Good luck to whoever sends the whole pack of you to
the galleys. A fitter place it will be for this scoundrel, where he may
serve his Majesty, instead of going about dancing from place to place,
and thieving from venta to mountain. On the faith of a soldier, I have a
mind to lay him at my feet with a blow."</p>
<p>So saying, without more ado he raised his hand, and gave Andrew such a
buffet as roused him from his stupor, and made him recollect that he was
not Andrew Caballero but Don Juan and a gentleman; therefore, flinging
himself upon the soldier with sudden fury, he snatched his sword from
its sheath, buried it in his body, and laid him dead at his feet. The
people shouted and yelled; the dead man's uncle, the alcalde, was
frantic with rage; Preciosa fainted, and Andrew, regardless of his own
defence, thought only of succouring her. As ill luck would have it,
Clement was not on the spot, having gone forward with some baggage, and
Andrew was set upon, by so many, that they overpowered him, and loaded
him with heavy chains. The alcalde would gladly have hanged him on the
spot, but was obliged to send him to Murcia, as he belonged to the
jurisdiction of that city. It was not, however, till the next day that
he was removed thither, and meanwhile he was loaded with abuse and
maltreatment by the alcalde and all the people of the place. The
alcalde, moreover, arrested all the rest of the gipsies he could lay
hands on, but most of them had made their escape, among others Clement,
who was afraid of being seized and discovered. On the following morning
the alcalde, with his officers and a great many other armed men, entered
Murcia with a caravan of gipsy captives, among whom were Preciosa and
poor Andrew, who was chained on the back of a mule, and was handcuffed
and had a fork fixed under his chin. All Murcia flocked to see the
prisoners, for the news of the soldier's death had been received there;
but so great was Preciosa's beauty that no one looked upon her that day
without blessing her. The news of her loveliness reached the
corregidor's lady, who being curious to see her, prevailed on her
husband to give orders that she should not enter the prison to which all
the rest of the gipsies were committed. Andrew was thrust into a dark
narrow dungeon, where, deprived of the light of the sun and of that
which Preciosa's presence diffused, he felt as though he should leave it
only for his grave. Preciosa and her grand-mother were taken to the
corregidor's lady, who at once exclaiming, "Well might they praise her
beauty," embraced her tenderly, and never was tired of looking at her.
She asked the old woman what was the girl's age. "Fifteen, within a
month or two, more or less," was the reply. "That would be the age of my
poor Constantia," observed the lady. "Ah, amigas! how the sight of this
young girl has brought my bereavement back afresh to my mind."</p>
<p>Upon this, Preciosa took hold of the corregidora's bands, kissed them
repeatedly, bathed them with tears, and said, "Se√±ora mia, the gitano
who is in custody is not in fault, for he had provocation. They called
him a thief, and he is none; they gave him a blow on the face, though
his is such a face that you can read in it the goodness of his soul. I
entreat you, se√±ora, to see that justice is done him, and that the se√±or
corregidor is not too hasty in executing upon him the penalty of the
law. If my beauty has given you any pleasure, preserve it for me by
preserving the life of the prisoner, for with it mine ends too. He is to
be my husband, but just and proper impediments have hitherto prevented
our union. If money would avail to obtain his pardon, all the goods of
our tribe should be sold by auction, and we would give even more than
was asked of us. My lady, if you know what love is, and have felt and
still feel it for your dear husband, have pity on me who love mine
tenderly and honestly."</p>
<p>All the while Preciosa was thus speaking she kept fast hold of the
corregidora's hands, and kept her tearful eyes fixed on her face, whilst
the lady gazed on her with no less wistfulness, and wept as she did.
Just then the corregidor entered, and seeing his wife and Preciosa thus
mingling their tears, he was surprised as much by the scene as by the
gitanilla's beauty. On his asking the cause of her affliction, Preciosa
let go the lady's hands, and threw herself at the corregidor's feet,
crying, "Mercy, mercy, se√±or! If my husband dies, I die too. He is not
guilty; if he is, let me bear the punishment; or if that cannot be, at
least let the trial be delayed until means be sought which may save him;
for as he did not sin through malice, it may be that heaven in its grace
will send him safety." The corregidor was still more surprised to hear
such language from the gitanilla's lips, and but that he would not
betray signs of weakness, he could have wept with her.</p>
<p>While all this was passing, the old gitana was busily turning over a
great many things in her mind, and after all this cogitation, she said,
"Wait a little, your honour, and I will turn these lamentations into
joy, though it should cost me my life;" and she stepped briskly out of
the room. Until she returned, Preciosa never desisted from her tears and
entreaties that they would entertain the cause of her betrothed, being
inwardly resolved that she would send to his father that he might come
and interfere in his behalf.</p>
<p>The old gipsy woman returned with a little box under her arm, and
requested that the corregidor and his lady would retire with her into
another room, for she had important things to communicate to them in
secret. The corregidor imagined she meant to give him information
respecting some thefts committed by the gipsies, in order to bespeak his
favour for the prisoner, and he instantly withdrew with her and his lady
to his closet, where the gipsy, throwing herself on her knees before
them both, began thus:</p>
<p>"If the good news I have to give to your honours be not worth
forgiveness for a great crime I have committed, I am here to receive the
punishment I deserve. But before I make my confession, I beg your
honours will tell me if you know these trinkets;" and she put the box
which contained those belonging to Preciosa into the corregidor's hands.
He opened it, and saw those childish gewgaws, but had no idea what they
could mean. The corregidora looked at them, too, with as little
consciousness as her husband, and merely observed that they were the
ornaments of some little child. "That is true," replied the gipsy, "and
to what child they belonged is written in this folded paper." The
corregidor hastily opened the paper, and read as follows:‚Äî</p>
<p>"<i>The child's name was Do√±a Constanza de Acevedo y de Menesis; her
mother's, Do√±a Guiomar de Menesis; and her father's, D. Fernando de
Acevedo, knight of the order of Calatrava. She disappeared on the day of
the Lord's Ascension, at eight in the morning, in the year one thousand
five hundred and ninety-five. The child had upon her the trinkets which
are contained in this box.</i>"</p>
<p>Instantly, on hearing the contents of the paper, the corregidora
recognised the trinkets, put them to her lips, kissed them again and
again, and swooned away; and the corregidor was too much occupied in
assisting her to ask the gitana for his daughter. "Good woman, angel
rather than gitana," cried the lady when she came to herself, "where is
the owner of these baubles?"</p>
<p>"Where, se√±ora?" was the reply. "She is in your own house. That young
gipsy who drew tears from your eyes is their owner, and is indubitably
your own daughter, whom I stole from your house in Madrid on the day and
hour named in this paper."</p>
<p>On hearing this, the agitated lady threw off her clogs, and rushed with
open arms into the sala, where she found Preciosa surrounded by her
doncellas and servants, and still weeping and wailing. Without a word
she caught her hurriedly in her arms, and examined if she had under her
left breast a mark in the shape of a little white mole with which she
was born, and she found it there enlarged by time. Then, with the same
haste, she took off the girl's shoe, uncovered a snowy foot, smooth as
polished marble, and found what she sought; for the two smaller toes of
the right foot were joined together by a thin membrane, which the tender
parents could not bring themselves to let the surgeon cut when she was
an infant. The mole on the bosom, the foot, the trinkets, the day
assigned for the kidnapping, the confession of the gitana, and the joy
and emotion which her parents felt when they first beheld her, confirmed
with the voice of truth in the corregidora's soul that Preciosa was her
own daughter: clasping her therefore in her arms, she returned with her
to the room where she had left the corregidor and the old gipsy.
Preciosa was bewildered, not knowing why she had made all those
investigations, and was still more surprised when the lady raised her in
her arms, and gave her not one kiss, but a hundred.</p>
<p>Do√±a Guiomar at last appeared with her precious burthen in her husband's
presence, and transferring the maiden from her own arms to his,
"Receive, Se√±or, your daughter Constanza," she said; "for your daughter
she is without any doubt, since I have seen the marks on the foot and
the bosom; and stronger even than these proofs is the voice of my own
heart ever since I set eyes on her."</p>
<p>"I doubt it not," replied the corregidor, folding Preciosa in his arms,
"for the same sensations have passed through my heart as through yours;
and how could so many strange particulars combine together unless it
were by a miracle?"</p>
<p>The people of the house were now lost in wonder, going about and asking
each other, "What is all this?" but erring widely in their conjectures;
for who would have imagined that the gitanilla was the daughter of
their lord? The corregidor told his wife and daughter and the old gipsy
that he desired the matter should be kept secret until he should himself
think fit to divulge it. As for the old gipsy, he assured her that he
forgave the injury she had done him in stealing his treasure, since she
had more than made atonement by restoring it. The only thing that
grieved him was that, knowing Preciosa's quality, she should have
betrothed her to a gipsy, and worse than that, to a thief and murderer.
"Alas, se√±or mio," said Preciosa, "he is neither a gipsy nor a thief,
although he has killed a man, but then it was one who had wounded his
honour, and he could not do less than show who he was, and kill him."</p>
<p>"What! he is not a gipsy, my child?" said Do√±a Guiomar.</p>
<p>"Certainly not," said the old gitana; and she related the story of
Andrew Caballero, that he was the son of Don Francisco de C√°rcamo,
knight of Santiago; that his name was Don Juan de C√°rcamo, of the same
order; and that she had kept his clothes after he had changed them for
those of a gipsy. She likewise stated the agreement which Preciosa and
Don Juan had made not to marry until after two years of mutual trial;
and she put in their true light the honourable conduct of both, and the
suitable condition of Don Juan.</p>
<p>The parents were as much surprised at this as at the recovery of their
daughter. The corregidor sent the gitana for Don Juan's clothes, and she
came back with them accompanied by a gipsy who carried them. Previously
to her return, Preciosa's parents put a thousand questions to her, and
she replied with so much discretion and grace, that even though they had
not recognised her for their child, they must have loved her. To their
inquiry whether she had any affection for Don Juan, she replied, not
more than that to which she was bound in gratitude towards one who had
humbled himself to become a gipsy for her sake; but even this should not
extend farther than her parents desired. "Say no more, daughter
Preciosa," said her father; "(for I wish you to retain this name of
Preciosa in memory of your loss and your recovery); as your father, I
take it upon myself to establish you in a position not derogatory to
your birth."</p>
<p>Preciosa sighed, and her mother shrewdly suspecting that the sigh was
prompted by love for Don Juan, said to the corregidor, "Since Don Juan
is a person of such rank, and is so much attached to our daughter, I
think, se√±or, it would not be amiss to bestow her upon him."</p>
<p>"Hardly have we found her to-day," he replied, "and already would you
have us lose her? Let us enjoy her company for a while at least, for
when she marries she will be ours no longer but her husband's."</p>
<p>"You are right, se√±or," said the lady, "but give orders to bring out Don
Juan, for he is probably lying in some filthy dungeon."</p>
<p>"No doubt he is," said Preciosa, "for as a thief and homicide, and above
all as a gipsy, they will have given him no better lodging."</p>
<p>"I will go see him," said the corregidor, "as if for the purpose of
taking his confession. Meanwhile, se√±ora, I again charge you not to let
any one know this history until I choose to divulge it, for so it
behoves my office." Then embracing Preciosa he went to the prison where
Don Juan was confined, and entered his cell, not allowing any one to
accompany him.</p>
<p>He found the prisoner with both legs in fetters, handcuffed, and with
the iron fork not yet removed from beneath his chin. The cell was dark,
only a scanty gleam of light passing into it from a loop-hole near the
top of the wall. "How goes it, sorry knave?" said the corregidor, as he
entered. "I would I had all the gipsies in Spain leashed here together
to finish them all at once, as Nero would have beheaded all Rome at a
single blow. Know, thou thief, who art so sensitive on the point of
honour, that I am the corregidor of this city, and come to know from
thee if thy betrothed is a gitanilla who is here with the rest of you?"</p>
<p>Hearing this Andrew imagined that the corregidor had surely fallen in
love with Preciosa; for jealousy is a subtle thing, and enters other
bodies without breaking or dividing them. He replied, however, "If she
has said that I am her betrothed, it is very true; and, if she has said
I am not her betrothed, she has also spoken the truth; for it is not
possible that Preciosa should utter a falsehood."</p>
<p>"Is she so truthful then?" said the corregidor. "It is no slight thing
to be so and be a gitana. Well, my lad, she has said that she is your
betrothed, but that she has not yet given you her hand; she knows that
you must die for your crime, and she has entreated me to marry her to
you before you die, that she may have the honour of being the widow of
so great a thief as yourself."</p>
<p>"Then, let your worship do as she has requested," said Andrew; "for so I
be married to her, I will go content to the other world, leaving this
one with the name of being hers."</p>
<p>"You must love her very much?"</p>
<p>"So much," replied the prisoner, "that whatever I could say of it would
be nothing to the truth. In a word, se√±or corregidor, let my business be
despatched. I killed the man who insulted me; I adore this young gitana;
I shall die content if I die in her grace, and God's I know will not be
wanting to us, for we have both observed honourably and strictly the
promise we made each other."</p>
<p>"This night then I will send for you," said the corregidor, "and you
shall marry Preciosa in my house, and to-morrow morning you shall be on
the gallows. In this way I shall have complied with the demands of
justice and with the desire of you both." Andrew thanked him; the
corregidor returned home, and told his wife what had passed between
them.</p>
<p>During his absence Preciosa had related to her mother the whole course
of her life; and how she had always believed she was a gipsy and the old
woman's grand-daughter; but that at the same time she had always
esteemed herself much more than might have been expected of a gitana.
Her mother bade her say truly, was she very fond of Don Juan? With great
bashfulness and with downcast eyes she replied that, having considered
herself a gipsy, and that she should better her condition by marrying a
knight of Santiago, and one of such station as Don Juan de C√°rcamo, and
having, moreover, learned by experience his good disposition and
honourable conduct, she had sometimes looked upon him with the eyes of
affection; but that as she had said once for all, she had no other will
than that which her parents might approve.</p>
<p>Night arrived; and about ten they took Andrew out of prison without
handcuffs and fetters, but not without a great chain with which his body
was bound from head to foot. In this way he arrived, unseen by any but
those who had charge of him, in the corregidor's house, was silently
and cautiously admitted into a room, and there left alone. A confessor
presently entered and bade him confess, as he was to die next day. "With
great pleasure I will confess," replied Andrew; "but why do they not
marry me first? And if I am to be married, truly it is a sad bridal
chamber that awaits me."</p>
<p>Do√±a Guiomar, who heard all this, told her husband that the terrors he
was inflicting on Don Juan were excessive, and begged he would moderate
them, lest they should cost him his life. The corregidor assented, and
called out to the confessor that he should first marry the gipsy to
Preciosa, after which the prisoner would confess, and commend himself
with all his heart to God, who often rains down his mercies at the
moment when hope is most parched and withering. Andrew was then removed
to a room where there was no one but Do√±a Guiomar, the corregidor,
Preciosa, and two servants of the family. But when Preciosa saw Don Juan
in chains, his face all bloodless, and his eyes dimmed with recent
weeping, her heart sank within her, and she clutched her mother's arm
for support. "Cheer up, my child," said the corregidora, kissing her,
"for all you now see will turn to your pleasure and advantage." Knowing
nothing of what was intended, Preciosa could not console herself; the
old gipsy was sorely disturbed, and the bystanders awaited the issue in
anxious suspense.</p>
<p>"Se√±or Vicar," said the corregidor, "this gitano and gitana are the
persons whom your reverence is to marry."</p>
<p>"That I cannot do," replied the priest, "unless the ceremony be preceded
by the formalities required in such cases. Where have the banns been
published? Where is the license of my superior, authorising the
espousals?"</p>
<p>"The inadvertance has been mine," said the corregidor; "but I will
undertake to get the license from the bishop's deputy."</p>
<p>"Until it comes then, your worships will excuse me," said the priest,
and without another word, to avoid scandal, he quitted the house,
leaving them all in confusion.</p>
<p>"The padre has done quite right," said the corregidor, "and it may be
that it was by heaven's providence, to the end that Andrew's execution
might be postponed; for married to Preciosa he shall assuredly be, but
first the banns must be published, and thus time will be gained, and
time often works a happy issue out of the worst difficulties. Now I want
to know from Andrew, should matters take such a turn, that without any
more of those shocks and perturbations, he should become the husband of
Preciosa, would he consider himself a happy man, whether as Andrew
Caballero, or as Don Juan de C√°rcamo?"</p>
<p>As soon as Don Juan heard himself called by his true name, he said,
"Since Preciosa has not chosen to confine herself to silence, and has
discovered to you who I am, I say to you, that though my good fortune
should make me monarch of the world, she would still be the sole object
of my desires; nor would I aspire to have any blessing besides, save
that of heaven."</p>
<p>"Now for this good spirit you have shown, Se√±or Don Juan de C√°rcamo, I
will in fitting time make Preciosa your lawful wife, and at present I
bestow her upon you in that expectation, as the richest jewel of my
house, my life, and my soul; for in her I bestow upon you Do√±a Constanza
de Acevedo Menesis, my only daughter, who, if she equals you in love, is
nowise inferior to you in birth."</p>
<p>Andrew was speechless with astonishment, while in a few words Do√±a
Guiomar related the loss of her daughter, her recovery, and the
indisputable proofs which the old gipsy woman had given of the
kidnapping. More amazed than ever, but filled with immeasurable joy, Don
Juan embraced his father and mother-in-law, called them his parents and
se√±ores, and kissed Preciosa's hands, whose tears called forth his own.
The secret was no longer kept; the news was spread abroad by the
servants who had been present, and reached the ears of the alcalde, the
dead man's uncle, who saw himself debarred of all hope of vengeance,
since the rigour of justice could not be inflicted on the corregidor's
son-in-law. Don Juan put on the travelling dress which the old woman had
preserved; his prison and his iron chain were exchanged for liberty and
chains of gold; and the sadness of the incarcerated gipsies was turned
into joy, for they were all bailed out on the following day. The uncle
of the dead man received a promise of two thousand ducats on condition
of his abandoning the suit and forgiving Don Juan. The latter, not
forgetting his comrade Clement, sent at once in quest of him, but he
was not to be found, nor could anything be learned of him until four
days after, when authentic intelligence was obtained that he had
embarked in one of two Genoese galleys that lay in the port of
Cartagena, and had already sailed. The corregidor informed Don Juan,
that he had ascertained that his father, Don Francisco de C√°rcanio, had
been appointed corregidor of that city, and that it would be well to
wait until the nuptials could be celebrated with his consent and
approbation. Don Juan was desirous to conform to the corregidor's
wishes, but said that before all things he must be made one with
Preciosa. The archbishop granted his license, requiring that the banns
should be published only once.</p>
<p>The city made a festival on the wedding-day, the corregidor being much
liked, and there were illuminations, bullfights, and tournaments. The
old woman remained in the house of her pretended grandchild, not
choosing to part from Preciosa. The news reached Madrid, and Don
Francisco de C√°rcamo learned that the gipsy bridegroom was his son, and
that Preciosa was the gitanilla he had seen in his house. Her beauty was
an excuse in his eyes for the levity of his son, whom he had supposed to
be lost, having ascertained that he had not gone to Flanders. Besides,
he was the more reconciled when he found what a good match Don Juan had
made with the daughter of so great and wealthy a cavalier as was Don
Fernando de Acevedo. He hastened his departure in order to see his
children, and within twenty days he was in Murcia. His arrival renewed
the general joy; the lives of the pair were related, and the poets of
that city, which numbers some very good ones, took it upon them to
celebrate the extraordinary event along with the incomparable beauty of
the gitanilla; and the licentiate Pozo wrote in such wise, that
Preciosa's fame will endure in his verses whilst the world lasts. I
forgot to mention that the enamoured damsel of the inn owned that the
charge of theft she had preferred against Andrew was not true, and
confessed her love and her crime, for which she was not visited with any
punishment, because the joyous occasion extinguished revenge and
resuscitated clemency.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00013"><a id="THE_GENEROUS_LOVER"/>THE GENEROUS LOVER.</h2>
<p>"O lamentable ruins of the ill-fated Nicosia,<a id="FNanchor_76_76"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-10.htm.html#Footnote_76_76" class="pginternal"><sup>[76]</sup></a> still moist with the
blood of your valorous and unfortunate defenders! Were you capable of
feeling, we might jointly bewail our disasters in this solitude, and
perhaps find some relief for our sorrows in mutually declaring them. A
hope may remain that your dismantled towers may rise again, though not
for so just a defence as that in which they fell; but I, unfortunate!
what good can I hope for in my wretched distress, even should I return
to my former state? Such is my hard fate, that in freedom I was without
happiness, and in captivity I have no hope of it."</p>
<p>These words were uttered by a captive Christian as he gazed from an
eminence on the ruined walls of Nicosia; and thus he talked with them,
comparing his miseries with theirs, as if they could understand him,‚Äîa
common habit with the afflicted, who, carried away by their
imaginations, say and do things inconsistent with all sense and reason.
Meanwhile there issued from a pavilion or tent, of which there were four
pitched in the plain, a young Turk, of good-humoured and graceful
appearance, who approached the Christian, saying, "I will lay a wager,
friend Ricardo, that the gloomy thoughts you are continually ruminating
have led you to this place."</p>
<p>"It is true," replied Ricardo, for that was the captive's name; "but
what avails it, since, go where I will, I find no relief from them; on
the contrary, the sight of yonder ruins have given them increased
force."</p>
<p>"You mean the ruins of Nicosia?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do, since there are no others visible here."</p>
<p>"Such a sight as that might well move you to tears," said the Turk;
"for any one who saw this famous and plenteous isle of Cyprus about two
years ago, when its inhabitants enjoyed all the felicity that is granted
to mortals, and who now sees them exiled from it, or captive and
wretched, how would it be possible not to mourn over its calamity? But
let us talk no more of these thing's, for which there is no remedy, and
speak of your own, for which I would fain find one. Now I entreat you,
by what you owe me for the good-will I have shown you, and for the fact
that we are of the same country, and were brought up together in
boyhood, that you tell me what is the cause of your inordinate sadness.
For even, admitting that captivity alone is enough to sadden the most
cheerful heart in the world, yet I imagine that your sorrows have a
deeper source; for generous spirits like yours do not yield to ordinary
misfortunes so much as to betray extraordinary grief on account of them.
Besides, I know that you are not so poor as to be unable to pay the sum
demanded for your ransom; nor are you shut up in the castles of the
Black Sea as a captive of consideration, who late or never obtains the
liberty he sighs for. Since, then, you are not deprived of the hope of
freedom, and yet manifest such deep despondency, I cannot help thinking
that it proceeds from some other cause than the loss of your liberty. I
entreat you to tell me what is that cause, and I offer you my help to
the utmost of my means and power. Who knows but that it was in order
that I might serve you that fortune induced me to wear this dress which
I abhor.</p>
<p>"You know, Ricardo, that my master is the cadi (which is the same thing
as the bishop) of this city. You know, too, how great is his power, and
my influence with him. Moreover, you are not ignorant of the ardent
desire I feel not to die in this creed, which I nominally profess; but
if it can be done in no other way, I propose to confess and publicly cry
aloud my faith in Jesus Christ, from which I lapsed by reason of my
youth and want of understanding. Such a confession I know will cost me
my life, which I will give freely, that I may not lose my soul. From all
this I would have you infer, and be assured, that my friendship may be
of some use to you. But that I may know what remedies or palliations
your case may admit of, it is necessary that you explain it to me, as
the sick man does to the doctor, taking my word for it, that I will
maintain the strictest secrecy concerning it."</p>
<p>Ricardo, who had listened in silence all this while, finding himself at
last obliged to reply, did so as follows: "If, as you have guessed
rightly, respecting my misfortune, friend Mahmoud," (that was the Turk's
name,) "so also you could hit upon the remedy for it, I should think my
liberty well lost, and would not exchange my mischance for the greatest
imaginable good fortune. But I know that it is such, that though all the
world should know the cause whence it proceeds, no one ever would make
bold to find for it a remedy, or even an alleviation. That you may be
satisfied of this truth, I will relate my story to you, as briefly as I
can; but before I enter upon the confused labyrinth of my woes, tell me
what is the reason why my master, Hassan Pasha, has caused these
pavilions to be pitched here in the plain, before he enters Nicosia, to
which he has been appointed pasha, as the Turks call their viceroys."</p>
<p>"I will satisfy you briefly," replied Mahmoud. "You must know, then,
that it is the custom among the Turks, for those who are sent as
viceroys of any province, not to enter the city in which their
predecessor dwells until he quits it, and leaves the new comer to take
up his residence freely; and when the new pasha has done so, the old one
remains encamped beyond the walls, waiting the result of the inquiry
into his administration, which is made without his being able to
interfere, and avail himself of bribery or affection, unless he has done
so beforehand. The result of the inquiry, enrolled on a sealed
parchment, is then given to the departing pasha, and this he must
present to the Sublime Porte, that is to say, the court in front of the
grand council of the Turk. It is then read by the vizier pasha and the
four lesser pashas, (or, as we should say, by the president and members
of the royal council,) who punish or reward the bearer according to its
contents; though, if these are not favourable, he buys off his
punishment with money. If there is no accusation against him, and he is
not rewarded, as commonly happens, he obtains by means of presents the
post he most desires; for, at that court, offices are not bestowed by
merit, but for money; everything is bought and sold. The bestowers of
office fleece the receivers; but he who purchases a post, makes enough
by it to purchase another which promises more profit.</p>
<p>"Everything proceeds as I tell you; in this empire all is violence: a
fact which betokens that it will not be durable; but, as I full surely
believe, it is our sins that uphold it, the sins, I mean, of those who
imprudently and forwardly offend God, as I am doing: may he forgive me
in his mercy!</p>
<p>"It is, then, for the reason I have stated that your master, Hassan
Pasha, has been encamped here four days, and if the Pasha of Nicosia has
not come out as he should have done, it is because he has been very ill.
But he is now better, and he will come out to-day or to-morrow without
fail, and lodge in some tents behind this hill, which you have not seen,
after which your master will immediately enter the city. And now I have
replied to the question you put to me."</p>
<p>"Listen, then, to my story," said Ricardo, "but I know not if I shall be
able to fulfil my promise to be brief, since my misfortune is so vast
that it cannot be comprised within any reasonable compass of words.
However, I will do what I may and as time allows. Let me ask you, in the
first place, if you knew in our town of Trapani, a young lady whom fame
pronounced to be the most beautiful woman in Sicily? A young lady, I
say, of whom the most ingenious tongues, and the choicest wits declared
that her beauty was the most perfect ever known in past ages or the
present, or that may be looked for in the future. One, of whom the poets
sang that she had hair of gold, that her eyes were two shining suns, her
cheeks roses, her teeth pearls, her lips rubies, her neck alabaster; and
that every part of her made with the whole, and the whole with every
part, a marvellous harmony and consonance, nature diffusing all over her
such an exquisite sweetness of tone and colour, that envy itself could
not find a fault in her. How is it possible, Mahmoud, that you have not
already named her? Surely you have either not listened to me, or when
you were in Trapani you wanted common sensibility."</p>
<p>"In truth, Ricardo," replied Mahmoud, "if she whom you have depicted in
such glowing colours is not Leonisa, the daughter of Rodolfo Florencio,
I know not who she is, for that lady alone was famed as you have
described."</p>
<p>"Leonisa it is, Mahmoud," exclaimed Ricardo; "Leonisa is the sole cause
of all my bliss and all my sorrow; it is for her, and not for the loss
of liberty, that my eyes pour forth incessant tears, my sighs kindle the
air, and my wailings weary heaven and the ears of men. It is she who
makes me appear in your eyes a madman, or at least a being devoid of
energy and spirit. This Leonisa, so cruel to me, was not so to another,
and this is the cause of my present miserable plight. For you must know
that, from my childhood, or at least from the time I was capable of
understanding, I not only loved, but adored and worshipped her, as
though I knew no other deity on earth. Her parents and relations were
aware of my affection for her, and never showed signs of disapproving
it, for they knew that my designs were honourable and virtuous; and I
know that they often said as much to Leonisa, in order to dispose her to
receive me as her betrothed; but she had set her heart on Cornelio, the
son of Ascanio Rotulo, whom you well know‚Äîa spruce young gallant,
<i>point-de-vice</i> in his attire, with white hands, curly locks,
mellifluous voice, amorous discourse‚Äîmade up, in short, of amber and
sugar-paste, garnished with plumes and brocade. She never cared to
bestow a look on my less dainty face, nor to be touched in the least by
my assiduous courtship; but repaid all my affection with disdain and
abhorrence; whilst my love for her grew to such an extreme, that I
should have deemed my fate most blest if she had killed me by her scorn,
provided she did not bestow open, though maidenly, favours on Cornelio.
Imagine the anguish of my soul, thus lacerated by her disdain, and
tortured by the most cruel jealousy. Leonisa's father and mother winked
at her preference for Cornelio, believing, as they well might, that the
youth, fascinated by her incomparable beauty, would chose her for his
wife, and thus they should have a wealthier son-in-law than myself. That
he might have been; but they would not have had one (without arrogance,
be it said) of better birth than myself, or of nobler sentiments or more
approved worth.</p>
<p>"Well, in the course of my wooing, I learned one day last May, that is
to say, about a year ago, that Leonisa and her parents, Cornelio and
his, accompanied by all their relations and servants had gone to enjoy
themselves in Ascanio's garden, close to the sea shore on the road to
the Saltpits.</p>
<p>"I know the place well," interrupted Mahmoud, "and passed many a merry
day there in better times. Go on, Ricardo."</p>
<p>"The moment I received information of this party, such an infernal fury
of jealousy possessed my soul that I was utterly distraught, as you will
see, by what I straightway did; and that was to go to the garden, where
I found the whole party taking their pleasure, and Cornelio and Leonisa
seated together under a nopal-tree, a little apart from the rest.</p>
<p>"What were their sensations on seeing me I know not, all I know is that
my own were such that a cloud came over my sight, and I was like a
statue without power of speech or motion. But this torpor soon gave way
to choler, which roused my heart's blood, and unlocked my hands and my
tongue. My hands indeed were for a while restrained by respect for that
divine face before me; but my tongue at least broke silence.</p>
<p>"'Now hast thou thy heart's content,' I cried, 'O mortal enemy of my
repose, thine eyes resting with so much composure on the object that
makes mine a perpetual fountain of tears! Closer to him! Closer to him,
cruel girl! Cling like ivy round that worthless trunk. Comb and part the
locks of that new Ganymede, thy lukewarm admirer. Give thyself up wholly
to the capricious boy on whom thy gaze is fixed, so that losing all hope
of winning thee I may lose too the life I abhor. Dost thou imagine,
proud, thoughtless girl, that the laws and usages which are acknowledged
in such cases by all mankind, are to give way for thee alone? Dost thou
imagine that this boy, puffed up with his wealth, vain of his looks,
presuming upon his birth, inexperienced from his youth, can preserve
constancy in love, or be capable of estimating the inestimable, or know
what riper years and experience know? Do not think it. One thing alone
is good in this world, to act always consistently, so that no one be
deceived unless it be by his own ignorance. In extreme youth there is
much inconstancy; in the rich there is pride; in the arrogant, vanity;
in men who value themselves on their beauty, there is disdain; and in
one who unites all these in himself, there is a fatuity which is the
mother of all mischief.</p>
<p>"'As for thee, boy, who thinkest to carry off so safely a prize more
due to my earnest love than to thy idle philandering, why dost thou not
rise from that flowery bank, and tear from my bosom the life which so
abhors thine? And that not for the insult thou puttest upon myself, but
because thou knowest not how to prize the blessing which fortune bestows
upon thee. 'Tis plain, indeed, how little thou esteemest it, since thou
wilt not budge to defend it for fear of ruffling the finical arrangement
of thy pretty attire. Had Achilles been of as placid temper as thou art,
Ulysses would certainly have failed in his attempt, for all his show of
glittering arms and burnished helmets. Go, play among thy mother's
maids; they will help thee to dress thy locks and take care of those
dainty hands that are fitter to wind silk than to handle a sword.'</p>
<p>"In spite of all these taunts Cornelio never stirred from his seat, but
remained perfectly still, staring at me as if he was bewitched. The loud
tones in which I spoke had brought round us all the people who were
walking in the garden, and they arrived in time to hear me assail
Cornelio with many other opprobrious terms. Plucking up heart, at last,
from the presence of numbers, most of whom were his relations, servants,
or friends, he made a show as if he would rise; but before he was on his
feet my sword was out, and I attacked not him only but all who were
before me. The moment Leonisa saw the gleam of my sword she swooned
away, which only exasperated my frantic rage. I know not whether it was
that those whom I assailed contented themselves with acting on the
defensive as against a raving madman, or that it was my own good luck
and adroitness, or Heaven's design to reserve me for greater ills, but
the fact was that I wounded seven or eight of those who came under my
hand. As for Cornelio, he made such good use of his heels that he
escaped me.</p>
<p>"In this imminent danger, surrounded by enemies who were now incensed to
vengeance, I was saved by an extraordinary chance; but better would it
have been to have lost my life on the spot than to be saved in order to
suffer hourly death. On a sudden the garden was invaded by a great
number of Turkish corsairs, who had landed in the neighbourhood without
being perceived by the sentinels in the castles on the coast, or by our
cruisers. As soon as my antagonists descried them they left me, and
escaped with all speed. Of all the persons in the garden the Turks
captured only three, besides Leonisa, who was still in her swoon. As for
me, I fell into their hands after receiving four ugly wounds, which,
however, I had revenged by laying four Turks dead upon the ground.</p>
<p>"The Turks having effected this onslaught with their usual expedition,
returned to their galleys, ill-satisfied with a success which had cost
them so dear. Having set sail they quickly arrived at Fabiana, where
mustering their hands to see who was missing, they found that they had
lost four Levantine soldiers whom they esteemed their best men. They
resolved to revenge the loss on me, and the commander of the galley
immediately ordered the yard-arm to be lowered in order to hang me.
Leonisa was present at all this. She had come to her senses, and seeing
herself in the power of the corsairs, she stood weeping and wringing her
delicate hands, without saying a word, but listening if she could
understand what was said by the Turks. One of the Christian slaves at
the oar told her in Italian that the captain had ordered that Christian
to be hanged, pointing to me, because he had killed in his own defence
four of the best soldiers belonging to the galley. On hearing this,
Leonisa (it was the first time she showed any pity for me) bade the
captive tell the Turks not to hang me, for they would lose a large
ransom, but return at once, to Trapani, where it would be paid them.
This, I say, was the first, as it will also be the last mark of
compassion bestowed on me by Leonisa, and all for my greater woe.</p>
<p>"The Turks believed what the captive told them: interest got the better
of their resentment, and they returned next morning with a flag of
peace. I passed a night of the greatest anguish, not so much from the
pain of my wounds, as from thinking of the danger in which my fair and
cruel enemy was placed among those barbarians. When we arrived at the
town one galley entered the port, the other remained in the offing. The
Christian inhabitants lined the whole shore, and the effeminate Cornelio
stood watching from a distance what was going on in the galley. My
steward immediately came to treat for my ransom, and I told him on no
account to bargain for it but for that of Leonisa, for which he should
offer all I was worth. I furthermore ordered him to return to shore, and
toll Leonisa's parents that they might leave it to him to treat for
their daughter's liberation, and give themselves no trouble about the
matter.</p>
<p>"The chief captain, who was a Greek renegade named Yusuf, demanded six
thousand crowns for Leonisa and four thousand for me, adding that he
would not give up the one without the other. He asked this large sum, as
I afterwards ascertained, because he was in love with Leonisa, and did
not wish to ransom her, but to give me and a thousand crowns to boot to
the other captain, with whom he was bound to share equally whatever
prizes they made, and to keep Leonisa for himself as valued at five
thousand crowns. It was for this reason that he appraised us both at ten
thousand.</p>
<p>"Leonisa's parents made no offer at all, relying on my promise, nor did
Cornelio so much as open his lips on the matter. After much bargaining
my steward agreed to pay five thousand crowns for Leonisa and three for
me, and Yusuf accepted this offer at the persuasion of the other captain
and of all his men. But as my agent had not so large an amount in ready
money, he asked for three days to get it in, being resolved to expend
all I possessed rather than fail to rescue us. Yusuf was glad of this,
thinking that something might possibly occur in the interval to prevent
the completion of the bargain, and he departed for the isle of Fabiana,
saying that in three days he would return for the money. But fortune,
never weary of persecuting me, ordained that a Turkish sentinel descried
from the highest point of the island, far out at sea, six vessels which
appeared to be either the Maltese squadron or one belonging to Sicily.
He ran down to give warning, and as quick as thought the Turks who were
on shore, some cooking their dinners, some washing their linen, embarked
again, heaved anchor, got out their oars, hoisted sail, and heading in
the direction of Barbary, in less than two hours lost sight of the
galleys. I leave you to conjecture, friend Mahmoud, what I suffered in
that voyage, so contrary to my expectation, and more when we arrived the
following day at the south-west of the isle of Pantanalea. There the
Turks landed, and the two captains began to divide all the prizes they
had made. All this was for me a lingering death.</p>
<p>"When Leonisa's turn and mine came, Yusuf gave Fatallah (the other
captain) myself and six other Christians, four of them fit for the oar,
and two very handsome Corsican boys, as an equivalent for Leonisa, whom
he himself retained; Fatallah being content with that arrangement. I was
present at all this, but knew not what they said, though I saw what they
did, nor should I have then understood the nature of the partition, had
not Fatallah come up to me and said in Italian, 'Christian, you now
belong to me; you have cost me two thousand crowns; if you desire your
liberty you must pay me four thousand, or else die here.' I asked him if
the Christian maiden was his also. He said she was not, but that Yusuf
had kept her with the intention to make her a Moor and marry her; and
this was true, for I was told the same thing by one of the Christian
rowers, who understood Turkish very well, and had overheard the
conversation that had passed between Yusuf and Fatallah. I told my
master to take measures for possessing himself of the maiden, and that I
would give him for her ransom alone ten thousand gold crowns. He replied
that it was impossible, but he would let Yusuf know the large sum I had
offered for the Christian girl, and perhaps he would be tempted to
change his intention and ransom her. He did so, and ordered all his crew
to go on board again immediately, for he intended to sail to Tripoli, to
which city he belonged. Yusuf also determined to make for Biserta, and
they all embarked with as much speed as they use when they discover
galleys to give them chase or merchant craft to plunder. They had reason
for this haste, for the weather seemed to be changing, and to threaten a
storm.</p>
<p>"Leonisa was ashore, but not where I could see her, until just as we
were embarking we met at the water side. Her new master and newer lover
led her by the hand, and as she set foot on the ladder that reached from
the shore to the galley, she turned her eyes upon me. Mine were fixed on
her, and such a pang of mingled tenderness and grief came over me that a
mist overspread my eyes, and I fell senseless on the ground. I was told
afterwards that Leonisa was affected in the same way, for she fell off
the ladder into the sea, into which Yusuf plunged after her and brought
her out in his arms. This was told me in my master's galley into which I
had been carried insensible. When I came to my senses, and found myself
there, and saw the other galley steering a different course and carrying
off the half of my soul or rather the whole of it, my heart sank within
me again; again I cursed my unhappy fate, and clamorously invoked!
death, till my master, annoyed by my loud lamentations, threatened me
with a great stick if I did not hold my tongue. I restrained my tears
and groans, believing that the force with which I compressed them would
make them burst a passage for my soul, which so longed to quit this
miserable body. But my misfortune did not end here. The storm which had
been foreseen suddenly burst upon us. The wind veered round to the south
and blew in our teeth with such violence that we were forced to quit our
course and run before it.</p>
<p>"It was the captain's intention to make for the island and take shelter
under its northern shore, but in this he was disappointed; for such was
the fury of the storm that although before it we had been making way
continually for two days and nights, yet in little more than fourteen
hours we saw ourselves again within six or seven miles of the island,
and driving helplessly against it, not where the shore was low, but just
where the rocks were highest and threatened us with inevitable death. We
saw near us the other galley, on board of which was Leonisa, and all its
Turk and captive rowers straining every nerve to keep themselves off the
rocks. Ours did the same, but with more success than the crew of our
consort, who, spent with toil, and vanquished in the desperate struggle
with the elements, let fall their oars, and suffered themselves to drift
ashore, where the galley struck with such violence that it was dashed to
pieces before our eyes.</p>
<p>"Night began to close in, and such were the shrieks of those who were
drowning, and the alarm of those on board our galley, that none of our
captain's orders were heard or executed. All the crew did, was to keep
fast hold of their oars, turn the vessel's head to the wind, and let go
two anchors, in hopes to delay for a little while the death that seemed
certain. Whilst all were in dread of dying, with me it was quite the
reverse; for in the fallacious hope of seeing in the other world her who
had so lately departed from this, every instant the galley delayed to
founder or drive ashore was to me an age of agony. I watched every
billow that dashed by us and over us, to see if they bore the body of
the unfortunate Leonisa. I will not detain you, Mahmoud, with a recital
of the tortures that distracted my soul in that long and bitter night;
it is enough to say that they were such that had death come, it would
have had little to do in bereaving me of life.</p>
<p>"Day broke with every appearance of worse weather than ever, and we
found that our vessel had shifted its course considerably, having
drifted away from the rocks and approached a point of the island.
Setting all of us to work, both Turks and Christians, with renewed hope
and strength, in six hours we doubled the point, and found ourselves in
calmer water, so that we could better use our oars; and the Turks saw a
prospect of going on shore to see if there were any remains of the
galley that had been wrecked the night before. But Heaven denied me the
consolation I hoped for in seeing in my arms the body of Leonisa. I
asked a renegade, who was about to land, to look for it and see if it
had been cast on the strand. But, as I have said, Heaven denied me this
consolation, for at that moment the wind rose with such fresh fury that
the shelter of the island was no longer of any avail to us.</p>
<p>"Seeing this, Fatallah would no longer strive against the fortune that
so persecuted him. He ordered some sail to be spread, turned the prow to
the sea and the poop to the wind, and himself taking the helm, let the
vessel run over the wide sea, secure of not being crossed in his way by
any impediment. The oars were all placed in their regular positions, the
whole crew was seated on the benches, and no one else was seen on foot
in the whole galley but the boatswain, who had lashed himself strongly
amidship for his greater security. The vessel flew so swiftly that in
three days and nights, passing in sight of Trapani, Melazo, and Palermo,
she entered the straits of Messina, to the dismay of all on board, and
of the spectators on shore. Not to be as long-winded as the storm that
buffeted us, I will only say that wearied, famishing, and exhausted by
such a long run, almost all round the island of Sicily, we arrived at
Tripoli, where my master, before he had divided the booty with his
partners, and accounted to the king for one-fifth part, according to
custom, was seized with such a pleurisy that in three days it carried
him off to hell.</p>
<p>"The king of Tripoli, and the alcayde of the Grand Turk, who, as you
know, is heir to all those who die without natural heirs, immediately
took possession of all Fatallah's effects. I became the property of the
then viceroy of Tripoli, who a fortnight afterwards received the patent
appointing him viceroy of Cyprus, and hither I am come with him without
any intention of redeeming myself. He has often told me to do so, since
I am a man of station, as Fatallah's soldiers informed him; I have never
complied, but have declared that he was deceived by those who had
exaggerated my means. If you would have me tell you my whole purpose,
Mahmoud, you must know that I desire not to turn in any direction in
which I may find any sort of consolation, but that the sad thoughts and
memories which have never left me since the death of Leonisa may become
so identified with my captive life that it may never afford me the least
pleasure. And if it is true that continual sorrow must at last wear out
itself, or him who suffers it, mine cannot fail to wear me out, for I am
resolved to give it such free scope that in a few days it shall put an
end to the wretched life I endure so unwillingly.</p>
<p>"This is, brother Mahmoud, my sad story; this is the cause of my sighs
and tears; judge now if it is enough to draw them forth from my inmost
vitals, and to engender them in the desolation of my afflicted heart,
Leonisa is dead, and with her all my hope; and though whilst she lived
it hung by the merest thread, yet, yet‚Äî"</p>
<p>Here the speaker's voice faltered, so that he could not utter another
word, or restrain the tears which coursed each other down his cheeks so
fast that they bedewed the ground. Mahmoud mingled his own with them;
and when the paroxysm had somewhat abated, he tried to console Ricardo
with the best suggestions he could offer; but the mourner cut them
short, saying, "What you have to do, friend, is to advise me how I shall
contrive to fall into disgrace with my master, and with all those I have
to do with, so that, being abhorred by him and by them, I may be so
maltreated and persecuted that I may find the death I so much long for."</p>
<p>"I have now," said Mahmoud, "experienced the truth of the common
saying, that what is deeply felt is well expressed, though it is true
that sometimes excess of feeling paralyses the tongue. Be that as it
may, friend Ricardo,‚Äîwhether your woes inspire your language, or your
language exalts your woes,‚Äîyou shall always find in me a true friend,
to aid or to counsel, though my youth, and the folly I committed in
assuming this garb, cry aloud that I am little to be relied on in this
capacity. I will try, however, to prove that such a conclusion is
unfounded; and though you do not desire either counsel or help, I will
not the more desist from doing what your case requires, just as people
give a sick man not what he asks for, but what is good for him. There is
no one who has more power and influence in this city than my master, the
Cadi; not even your own master, who comes to it as viceroy, will have so
much. This being the case, I may say that I am the most powerful person
here, since I can do what I please with my master. I mention this
because it may be that I shall so contrive with him that you shall
become his property, and being constantly with me, time will tell us
what we had best do, both for your consolation, if you will or can be
consoled, and to enable me to exchange the life I lead here for a better
one."</p>
<p>"I thank you, Mahmoud, for the friendship you offer me," replied
Ricardo, "though I well know that, do what you may, it will avail
nothing. But let us quit this subject, and go to the tents, for, as I
perceive, great numbers of people are coming forth from the city; no
doubt it is the old viceroy who is quitting it to give place to my
master."</p>
<p>"It is so," said Mahmoud. "Come then, Ricardo, and you will see the
ceremony of the reception."</p>
<p>"Come on," said Ricardo; "perhaps I shall have need of you, if the
superintendent of my master's slaves have missed me, for he is a
Corsican renegade of no very tender heart."</p>
<p>Here the conversation ended, and the two friends reached the tents, just
as the new pasha was coming out to receive his predecessor, Ali Pasha.
The latter came attended by all the janissaries who have formed the
garrison of Nicosia ever since the Turks have had possession of it, in
number about five hundred. They marched in two divisions, the one armed
with guns, the other with drawn scimetars. Arrived at the tent of
Hassan, the new Pasha, they all surrounded it. Ali made a low obeisance
to Hassan, who returned the salutation, but did not bow so low. Ali then
entered Hassan's tent, and the Turks placed the new Pasha on a powerful
steed, richly caparisoned, and led him round the tents, and up and down
the plain; vociferating in their own language, "Long live Sultan
Soliman, and Hassan Pasha, his representative!" which cry they
frequently repeated, and each time louder and louder. This part of the
ceremony being ended, they brought Hassan back to Ali's tent, where the
two pashas and the cadi remained alone together for an hour to consult,
as Mahmoud informed Ricardo, as to what was to be done upon some works
which Ali had begun. Afterwards the cadi appeared at the door of the
tent, and proclaimed in Turkish, Arabic, and Greek, that all who desired
to crave justice or make any other appeal against Ali Pasha, might now
enter freely, for there was Hassan Pasha, sent by the Grand Signor to be
viceroy of Cyprus, who would accord them all reason and justice.</p>
<p>In conformity with this permission the janissaries opened a passage to
the door of the tent, and every one entered who pleased. Mahmoud made
Ricardo go in along with him, for being Hassan's slave his entrance was
not opposed. Several Greek Christians and some Turks appeared as
appellants, but all upon such trifling matters, that the cadi despatched
most of them without the formality of written declarations, rejoinders,
and replications. It is, in fact, the custom of the Turks that all
causes, except those which relate to marriage, shall be immediately and
summarily decided, rather by the rules of common sense than of legal
precedent; and among these barbarians (if such they are in this respect)
the cadi is the sole judge in all cases, cuts short the pleadings, gives
sentence in a breath, and there is no appeal from his decision.
Presently a khawass (that is to say, a Turkish alguazil) entered and
said that a Jew stood without, at the door of the tent, with a most
beautiful Christian maiden for sale. The cadi gave orders to admit him.
The khawass withdrew and immediately returned, accompanied by a Jew of
venerable appearance, who led by the hand a young woman clothed in the
Moorish dress, which became her so well that the most richly arrayed
women of Fez or Morocco could not be compared with her, though in the
art of adorning themselves they surpass all the other women of Africa,
not excepting even those of Algiers, with all their profusion of pearls.</p>
<p>The face of the female slave was covered with a mask of crimson taffety.
On her naked ankles she wore two rings, apparently of pure gold; and two
others, set with large pearls, on her arms, which shone through the
sleeves of a transparent camisole. Her whole dress was rich, gay, and
graceful. Struck by her appearance, the first thing the cadi and the
pashas did, was to bid the Jew make the Christian uncover her face. She
did so, and disclosed a countenance which, like the sun bursting through
thick clouds which have long obscured it, dazzled the eyes and gladdened
the hearts of the beholders. But on none did that marvellous light
produce such an effect as on the woe-worn Ricardo, for he saw before him
no other than his cruel and beloved Leonisa, whom he had so often and
with such bitter tears bewailed as dead.</p>
