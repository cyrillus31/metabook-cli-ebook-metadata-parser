atrocity committed by the Infant Don Juan of Castille, who, while in
revolt against his brother, Sancho IV., appeared before the city of
Tarifa with an army, chiefly composed of Mahometans; finding the infant
son of the governor, Don Alonzo Perez de Guzman, at nurse in a
neighbouring village, he took the child, and bearing him to the foot of
the walls, called on Guzman to surrender the place on pain of seeing his
infant slaughtered before his eyes in case of refusal. The only reply
vouchsafed by Don Alonzo was the horrible one alluded to in the text. He
detached his own dagger from its belt, and threw it to Don Juan, when
the sanguinary monster, far from respecting the fidelity of his
opponent, seized the weapon, and pierced the babe to the heart as he had
threatened to do This anecdote is related, with certain variations, in

<p>Two students were one day passing along the banks of the Tormes, when
they found a boy, about eleven years old, dressed as a labourer, and
sleeping under a tree. They sent a servant to wake him, and when he had
well opened his eyes, they asked him whence he came, and what he was
doing, to be lying asleep and defenceless in that lonely place. The boy
replied, that he had forgotten the name of his birthplace, but was going
to Salamanca, there to seek a master whom he might serve, on condition
of being permitted and aided to pursue his studies.</p>
<p>The gentlemen then asked if he could read, and he replied that he could,
and write also.</p>
<p>"It is not from want of memory, then, that you have forgotten the name
of your country," remarked the students.</p>
<p>"Let the cause be what it may," replied the boy, "neither that nor the
name of my parents shall be known to any one until I can do honour to
them both."</p>
<p>"But in what manner do you propose to do them honour?" inquired the
gentlemen.</p>
<p>"By the results of my studies," said the boy, "and when I have rendered
myself famous by the learning I mean to acquire; for I have heard that
some men have made themselves bishops by their studies."</p>
<p>This reply moved the two gentlemen to receive the lad into their
service, and take him with them to Salamanca, giving him such facilities
for studying as it is not unusual for masters to afford in that
university to those who serve them.</p>
<p>The youth subsequently informed his masters, that they might call him
Thomas Rodaja; whence the students judged him to be the son of some poor
labourer. A day or two after their meeting, they caused him to be
clothed in a suit of black; and, in the course of a few weeks, he gave
proof of extraordinary talent. He was, besides, very grateful, and
laboured so earnestly in the service of his masters, that although in
fact exceedingly attentive to his studies, it might well have been
thought that he did nothing but wait upon those he served.</p>
<p>Now the good service of the valet led the masters to treat him well;
Thomas soon became their companion rather than servant, and, during
eight years, all of which he passed with them, he acquired for himself
so high a reputation in the university, by his great ability and
excellent conduct, that he was beloved and esteemed by those of every
rank.</p>
<p>The principal object of Rodaja's study was the law, but he was almost
equally distinguished in polite learning, and his memory was matter of
marvel to all; and the correctness of his views on all subjects was not
less remarkable.</p>
<p>The time had now arrived when the studies of his masters were completed,
and they returned to their birthplace, which was one of the most
important cities of Andalusia. They took Rodaja with them, and he
remained in their company for some time; but, assailed by a perpetual
longing to return to his studies at Salamanca,—a city that enchains the
will of all who have tasted the amenities of life in that fair seat of
learning—he entreated permission of his masters to depart for that
purpose. With their usual kindness, they accorded him the favour he
desired, and took such measures in his behalf that by their bounty he
was supplied with a sufficiency to support him in the university for
three years.</p>
<p>Rodaja took his leave with manifest proofs of gratitude, and departed
from Malaga, for that was the native city of his masters, without
further delay. Descending the declivity of the Zambra on the road to
Antequera, he chanced to encounter a gentleman on horseback, gaily
accoutred in a rich travelling dress, and attended by two servants, also
on horseback, whose company he joined; their journey thenceforward lay
in the same direction, and the gentleman accepted Thomas as his
comrade.<a id="FNanchor_51_51"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_51_51" class="pginternal"><sup>[51]</sup></a> They discoursed of various matters, and, in a short time,
Rodaja gave such proof of his quality as much delighted his
fellow-traveller; while the latter, on his part, soon proved himself to
be a kind and courteous man. He told Rodaja that he was a captain of
infantry in the service of the king, and that his ensign was then
completing their company at Salamanca. He praised the life of a soldier
in the highest terms, describing, with much encomium, the many cities
and other places visited by those who lead that life. Among other themes
of which he spoke were the beauty of Naples, the feasting and pleasures
of Palermo, the rich abundance of Milan, and the frequent festivals held
in other parts of Lombardy—not omitting the good cheer of the numerous
hostelries—in the description of which he broke forth rapturously in
the Tuscan language, discoursing of <i>Macarela</i>, <i>Macarroni</i>, and
<i>Polastri</i>, with the most cordial goodwill. He expatiated largely on the
free enjoyment of life in Italy, and on the pleasures of the soldier's
life in general, which he exalted to the skies; but he did not say a
word of the chilling night-watch, the perils of the assault, the terrors
of battle, the hunger and privation endured in blockades and sieges, or
the ruin caused by mines, with other matters of similar kind whereof he
might have spoken, but which he passed over in silence—although there
are those who would consider such things as having something to do with
the life of the soldier, not to call them its principal features. In a
word, he said so much on the subject, that the resolution of our Thomas
Rodaja began to waver, and his inclination went near to fix itself on
that life, which is so near a neighbour to death.</p>
<p>The captain, whose name was Don Diego de Valdivia, charmed, on his part,
with the handsome looks, cheerful manners, and admirable abilities of
Rodaja, entreated him to accompany the march into Italy, were it only
for the purpose of seeing the country. He offered him his table, and
even, if he would adopt the military life, he proposed to procure him a
pair of colours; nay, he assured him that those of his own regiment
would soon be vacant, and should be at his service.</p>
<p>But little persuasion was required to induce Rodaja's acceptance of a
part of this offer. Weighing it in his mind, he considered that it would
be well to see Italy and Flanders, to say nothing of other countries,
since travel contributes to increase knowledge and discretion. He
thought, too, that although he should spend three, or even four years
in that occupation, yet these, added to the few he then counted, would
not make him so old but that he might afterwards return to his studies.
These and other considerations had their weight, and the opportunity
being so much to his taste, Rodaja finally told the captain that he
would go with him into Italy; but it must be on condition of being left
at perfect liberty. He would not consent to enlist under his banner, nor
to have his name enrolled in the books of the regiment, that he might
not be subjected to the restraints of service. The captain represented
that his being inscribed on the lists was a matter which involved no
duty, and that he would thereby obtain all the appointments, with the
regular pay accorded to his rank; while he, Don Diego, would take care
that he should have leave of absence whenever he might demand it. Yet
Rodaja was not to be moved from his determination. "For this," said he,
"would be to act against the dictates of my conscience and of yours,
señor captain; I would, besides, much rather go free than be attached to
military service in any manner."</p>
<p>"A conscience so scrupulous is more suitable to the cowl of a monk than
the helmet of a soldier," said Don Diego, laughing; "but let it be as
you will, so we but remain comrades."</p>
<p>The first night of their journey they had passed at Antequera, and
making long stages each day, they speedily arrived at the place where
the captain was to join his company. All arrangements being completed,
the company began its march with four others to Carthagena, quartering
at such places as fell in their way.</p>
<p>And now Rodaja could not fail to remark the authority assumed by the
commissaries; the intractable character of many among the captains; the
rapacity of the quartermasters, and the unreasonable nature of their
demands; the fashion in which the paymasters managed their accounts; the
complaints of the people; the traffic in and exchange of billets; the
insolence of the undisciplined troops; their quarrels with the other
guests at the inns; the requisition of more rations and other stores
than were rightful or necessary; and, finally, the almost inevitable
consequences of all this. Much besides came under his observation,
which he could not but see to be in every way wrong and injurious.</p>
<p>For Rodaja himself, he had now abandoned the garb of a student, and
dressed himself parrot-fashion (as we say), conforming to such things as
the life around him presented. The many books he had possessed were now
reduced to the "Orisons of Our Lady," and a "Garcilaso without
Comments," which he carried in two of his pockets.</p>
<p>The party with which he travelled arrived at Carthagena much earlier
than he desired, for the varied life he led was very pleasant, and each
day brought something new and agreeable. At Carthagena the troops
embarked in four galleys for Naples; and in his cabin, also, Kodaja made
many observations on the strange life passed in those maritime houses,
where, for the most part, a man is devoured by vermin and destroyed by
rats, vexed by the sailors, robbed by the galley-slaves, and tormented
by the swell of the waters. He endured terrible fear from violent storms
and tempests, more especially in the Gulf of Lyons, where they had two,
by one of which they were cast on the Island of Corsica, while the other
drove them back upon Toulon, in France. At last, weary and half-drowned,
they reached land in the darkness of the night, and with great
difficulty arrived at the most peaceful and beautiful city of Genoa.</p>
<p>Having disembarked, and hastily visited a church to return thanks for
their safety, the captain with all his comrades adjourned to a tavern,
where they quickly forgot past storms and tempests in present rejoicing
and feasting.</p>
<p>Here they learned to appreciate the respective merits of the different
wines presented to them by their active and voluble host; the delicacy
of Trebbiano, the fine body of Montefiascone, the purity of Asperino,
the generous spirit of the wines from Candia and Soma, and the strength
of those from the Cincovinas, or Five Vineyards. Neither did they
disregard the sweetness and amenity of the Señora Guarnacha, or the
rustic bloom of the Centola, not forgetting even in this bright array
the humble Romanesco, which likewise came in for its meed of praise.</p>
<p>The host having passed in review all these and other wines, of many
various qualities, offered besides to place before his guests, without
having any recourse to magic, and not as one marks down places on a
map, but in all their vivid reality, Madriga, Coca, Alacjos, and the
imperial, rather than royal city—that favourite abode of the god of
smiles—Ciudad Real. He furthermore offered Esquibias, Alanis, Cazalla,
Guadalcanal, and Membrilla, without forgetting the wines of Ribadavia or
of Descargamaria. At a word, the host offered and even gave them more
wines than Bacchus himself could have stored in all his cellars.</p>
<p>Nor was the good Thomas unmindful of the admiration due to the radiant
locks of the Genoese maidens, renowned for those fair tresses, while he
likewise appreciated the obliging and cheerful disposition of the male
inhabitants, and was never weary of expatiating on the beauty of the
city itself, which, as you look at it from the sea, appears to hold the
houses enchased amidst the rocks, as diamonds are set in gold.</p>
<p>The day after their arrival, such of the companies as were destined for
Piedmont were disembarked; Rodaja, however, had no wish to proceed
thither, but determined to go from Genoa by land to Rome and Naples, and
return by the way of Our Lady of Loretto to the great and magnificent
Venice, and thence to Milan and Piedmont, where it was agreed that he
should rejoin Don Diego, if the latter had not previously been compelled
to set off for Flanders, as was expected.</p>
<p>Two days after these arrangements were made, Rodaja took leave of the
captain, and in five days from that time he reached Florence, having
first seen Lucca, a city which is small but very well built, and one
where Spaniards are more kindly received and better treated than in any
other part of Italy.</p>
<p>With Florence Rodaja was infinitely delighted, as well for the
pleasantness of its position as for its sumptuous buildings, its fine
river, agreeable streets, and cleanliness of aspect. He remained there
but four days, and then departed for Rome, the queen of cities and
mistress of the world, whose temples he visited, whose relics he adored,
and whose grandeur he admired: and as from the claws of the lion you may
judge of its mass and force, so did Rodaja infer the greatness of Rome
from the fragments of her marbles—her statues, broken or entire—her
arches, fallen or fractured—her baths, crumbled to ruin—her
magnificent porticos and vast amphitheatres—her renowned and holy
river, which ever fills the banks with water to the brim, while it
blesses them with innumerable remains of the martyrs whose bodies have
found a burial beneath its waves. Nor did our traveller fail to estimate
the beauty of the bridges, which one might fancy to be admiring each
other, or the streets, which, by their very names alone, claim authority
and pre-eminence over those of all other cities in the world: the Via
Flaminia, for example, the Via Julia, the Appia, and others of the same
character.</p>
<p>No less was Rodaja satisfied with the division of those hills which
exist within the city itself, the Cælian, the Quirinal, the Vatican, and
the other four, whose very names bear evidence to the Roman greatness
and majesty. He took careful note, moreover, of that authority which
attaches to the College of Cardinals, and of the dignity represented in
the person of the Supreme Pontiff; nor did he suffer to pass unnoticed
that great concourse and variety of men from all nations ever
congregated within the walls of the city.</p>
<p>All these things Rodaja admired, reflected on, and arranged in the order
of their importance; and having made the station of the Seven Churches,
confessed to a Penitentiary, and kissed the feet of his Holiness, he
departed, well loaded with <i>Agnus Deis</i> and legends, determining thence
to proceed to Naples.</p>
<p>But the time was one of important changes and much disorder; this
rendered the roads dangerous for all desiring to enter or travel out of
Rome; and as he had come to the city by land, so he now resolved to
depart by sea, wherefore, proceeding to the port of Ostia, he there
embarked, and having reached Naples, added to the satisfaction which he
had previously felt at seeing Rome, that of finding himself in a city,
in his estimation, and in the opinion of all who have seen it, the
finest in Europe, or even in the whole world.</p>
<p>From Naples, Rodaja proceeded to Sicily, where he visited Palermo and
Messina; the first of these cities he admired for the advantages of its
position and its beauty, and the second for the convenience of its port;
while to the whole island he could not but offer the tribute of his
praise for that abundance which causes it to be justly denominated the
granary of all Italy.</p>
<p>Returning from Sicily to Naples and Rome, Rodaja thence proceeded to Our
Lady of Loretto, in whose Holy Temple he could see neither walls nor
partitions, since every part was covered with crutches, biers, shrouds,
chains, padlocks, fetters, and locks of hair; with arms, hands, legs, or
busts in wax, to say nothing of pictures and prints, all giving manifest
indication of the mercies and favours innumerable which hundreds of men
have received in that place from the hand of God, by the intercession of
his Divine Mother, whose sacred Image (there preserved) He has been
pleased to exalt and sanction by a vast number of miracles, which have
been performed in recompense of the devotion of her votaries; for by
them it is that the walls of her house have been adorned in the manner
described.<a id="FNanchor_52_52"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_52_52" class="pginternal"><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>
<p>Here Rodaja beheld that very chamber of the Virgin, wherein was
delivered the most stupendous embassy ever heard or witnessed by all the
heavens, all the angels, and all the archangels, or other inhabitants of
the everlasting abodes.</p>
<p>From this place our traveller proceeded to Ancona, where he embarked and
repaired to Venice, a city which, had Columbus never appeared in the
world, would certainly be still supposed to have no equal; but, by the
favour of heaven, and thanks to the great Fernando Cortez who conquered
Mexico, the magnificent Venice has now found a city that may be compared
to herself. The streets of these two renowned capitals, which are almost
wholly of water, make them the admiration and terror of all
mankind—that of Europe dominating the old world, and that of America
the new. For of the former it would appear that her riches are infinite,
her position impregnable, her government most wise, the abundance of her
products inexhaustible; in a word, she is herself, as a whole, and in
all her parts, entirely worthy of that fame for greatness and majesty
which has penetrated to all the regions of the world: the justice of the
praise bestowed on Venice is, besides, accredited by her renowned
arsenal, wherein are constructed her potent galleys, with other vessels
of which the number is not to be told.</p>
<p>To our curious traveller the delights and pastimes found in Venice had
almost proved fatal as those of Calypso, since they had nearly caused
him to forget his first intentions. Yet when he had passed a month in
that enchanting place, he found resolution to continue his journey,
passing by Ferrara, Parma, and Placentia, to Milan, that workshop of
Vulcan—that grudge and despair of France—that superb city of which
more wonders are reported than words can tell, her own grandeur being
increased by that of her famous Temple, and by the marvellous abundance
of all things necessary to human life that are to be found therein.</p>
<p>From Milan, Rodaja journeyed to Asti, where he arrived in very good
time, since the regiment of Don Diego was to depart for Flanders on the
following day. He was received very kindly by his friend the captain,
with whom he passed into Flanders, and arrived at Antwerp, a city no
less worthy of admiration than those which he had seen in Italy. He
visited Ghent and Brussels likewise, finding the whole country preparing
to take arms, and well disposed to enter on the campaign of the
following year.</p>
<p>Rodaja having now seen all that he had desired to behold, resolved to
return to his native Spain, and to the city of Salamanca, there to
complete his studies. He had no sooner determined than he instantly put
his purpose into execution, to the great regret of his friend, who,
finding him resolved to depart, entreated him at least to write him word
of his safe arrival, and likewise of his future success. This Rodaja
promised to do, and then returned to Spain through France, but he did
not see Paris, which was at that time in arms. At length he arrived at
Salamanca, where he was well received by his friends, and with the
facilities which they procured him, he continued his studies until he
finally attained to the degree of doctor of laws.</p>
<p>Now it chanced that, about this time, there arrived in Salamanca one of
those ladies who belong to all the points of the compass; she was
besides well furnished with devices of every colour. To the whistle and
bird-call of this fowler there instantly came flocking all the birds of
the place; nor was there a <i>vade mecum</i><a id="FNanchor_53_53"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_53_53" class="pginternal"><sup>[53]</sup></a> who refrained from paying a
visit to that gay decoy. Among the rest our Thomas was informed that the
Señora said she had been in Italy and Flanders when he, to ascertain if
he were acquainted with the dame, likewise paid her a visit. She, on her
part, immediately fell in love with Rodaja, but he rejected her
advances, and never approached her house but when led thither by others,
and almost by force. Attending much more zealously to his studies than
his amusements, he did not in any manner return her affection, even when
she had made it known to him by the offer of her hand and all her
possessions.</p>
<p>Seeing herself thus scorned, and perceiving that she could not bend the
will of Rodaja by ordinary means, the woman determined to seek others,
which in her opinion would be more efficacious, and must, as she
thought, ensure the desired effect. So, by the advice of a Morisca
woman, she took a Toledan quince, and in that fruit she gave him one of
those contrivances called charms, thinking that she was thereby forcing
him to love her; as if there were, in this world, herbs, enchantments,
or words of power, sufficient to enchain the free-will of any creature.
These things are called charms, but they are in fact poisons: and those
who administer them are actual poisoners, as has been proved by sundry
experiences.</p>
<p>In an unhappy moment Rodaja ate the quince, but had scarcely done so
when he began to tremble from head to foot as if struck by apoplexy,
remaining many hours before he could be brought to himself. At the end
of that time he partially recovered, but appeared to have become almost
an idiot. He complained, with a stammering tongue and feeble voice, that
a quince which he had eaten had poisoned him, and also found means to
intimate by whom it had been given, when justice at once began to move
in quest of the criminal; but she, perceiving the failure of her
attempt, took care to hide herself, and never appeared again.</p>
<p>Six months did Thomas remain confined to his bed; and during that time
he not only became reduced to a skeleton, but seemed also to have lost
the use of his faculties. Every remedy that could be thought of was
tried in his behalf; but although the physicians succeeded in curing the
physical malady, they could not remove that of the mind; so that when he
was at last pronounced cured, he was still afflicted with the strangest
madness that was ever heard of among the many kinds by which humanity
has been assailed. The unhappy man imagined that he was entirely made of
glass; and, possessed with this idea, when any one approached him he
would utter the most terrible outcries, begging and beseeching them not
to come near him, or they would assuredly break him to pieces, as he was
not like other men but entirely of glass from head to foot.</p>
<p>In the hope of rousing him from this strange hallucination, many
persons, without regard to his prayers and cries, threw themselves upon
him and embraced him, bidding him observe that he was not broken for all
that. But all they gained by this was to see the poor creature sink to
the earth, uttering lamentable moans, and instantly fall into a fainting
fit, from which he could not be recovered for several hours; nay, when
he did recover, it was but to renew his complaints, from which he never
desisted but to implore that such a misfortune might not be suffered to
happen again.</p>
<p>He exhorted every one to speak to him from a great distance; declaring
that on this condition they might ask him what they pleased, and that he
could reply with all the more effect, now he was a man of glass and not
of flesh and bones, since glass, being a substance of more delicate
subtlety, permits the soul to act with more promptitude and efficacy
than it can be expected to do in the heavier body formed of mere earth.</p>
<p>Certain persons then desiring to ascertain if what he had said were
true, asked him many questions of great difficulty respecting various
circumstances; to all these he replied with the utmost acuteness,
insomuch that his answers awakened astonishment in the most learned
professors of medicine and philosophy whom that university could boast.
And well they might be amazed at seeing a man who was subject to so
strange an hallucination as that of believing himself to be made of
glass, still retain such extraordinary judgment on other points as to be
capable of answering difficult questions with the marvellous propriety
and truth which distinguished the replies of Rodaja.</p>
<p>The poor man had often entreated that some case might be given to him
wherein he might enclose the brittle vase of his body, so that he might
not break it in putting on the ordinary clothing. He was consequently
furnished with a surplice of ample width, and a cloth wrapper, which he
folded around him with much care, confining it to his waist with a
girdle of soft cotton, but he would not wear any kind of shoes. The
method he adopted to prevent any one from approaching him when they
brought him food, was to fix an earthen pot into the cleft of a stick
prepared for that purpose, and in this vessel he would receive such
fruits as the season presented. He would not eat flesh or fish; nor
would he drink anything but the water of the river, which he lapped from
his hands.</p>
<p>In passing through the streets, Rodaja was in the habit of walking
carefully in the middle of them, lest a tile should fall from the houses
upon his head and break it. In the summer he slept in the open air, and
in the winter he lodged at one of the inns, where he buried himself in
straw to his throat, remarking that this was the most proper and secure
bed for men of glass. When it thundered, Rodaja trembled like an aspen
leaf, and would rush out into the fields, not returning to the city
until the storm had passed.</p>
<p>His friends kept him shut up for some time, but perceiving that his
malady increased, they at last complied with his earnest request that
they would let him go about freely; and he might be seen walking through
the streets of the city, dressed as we have described, to the
astonishment and regret of all who knew him.</p>
<p>The boys soon got about him, but he kept them off with his staff,
requesting them to speak to him from a distance, lest they should break
him, seeing that he, being a man of glass, was exceedingly tender and
brittle. But far from listening to his request, the boys, who are the
most perverse generation in the world, soon began to throw various
missiles and even stones at him, notwithstanding all his prayers and
exclamations. They declared that they wished to see if he were in truth
of glass, as he affirmed; but the lamentations and outcries of the poor
maniac induced the grown persons who were near to reprove and even beat
the boys, whom they drove away for the moment, but who did not fail to
return at the next opportunity.</p>
<p>One day, that a horde of these tormentors had pursued him with more than
their usual pertinacity, and had worn out his patience, he turned to
them, saying—"What do you want with me you varlets? more obstinate than
flies, more disgusting than <i>Chinches</i>,<a id="FNanchor_54_54"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_54_54" class="pginternal"><sup>[54]</sup></a> and bolder than the boldest
fleas. Am I, perchance, the Monte Testacio<a id="FNanchor_55_55"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_55_55" class="pginternal"><sup>[55]</sup></a> of Rome, that you cast
upon me so many potsherds and tiles?" But Rodaja was followed by many
who kept about him for the purpose of hearing him reply to the questions
asked, or reprove the questioner, as the case might be. And after a
time, even the boys found it more amusing to listen to his words than to
throw tiles at him; when they gave him, for the most part, somewhat less
annoyance.</p>
<p>The maniac Bodaja was one day passing through the Ropery at Salamanca,
when a woman who was working there accosted him, and said, "By my soul,
Señor Doctor, I am sorry for your misfortune, but what shall I do for
you, since, try as I may, I cannot weep?" To which Rodaja, fixedly
regarding her, gravely replied, "<i>Filiæ Jerusalem, plorate super vos et
super filios vestros</i>." The husband of the ropeworker was standing by,
and comprehending the reply, he said to Rodaja, "Brother Glasscase, for
so they tell me you are to be called, you have more of the rogue than
the fool in you!" "You are not called on to give me an obolus," rejoined
Rodaja, "for I have not a grain of the fool about me!" One day that he
was passing near a house well known as the resort of thieves and other
disorderly persons, he saw several of the inhabitants assembled round
the door, and called out, "See, here you have baggage belonging to the
army of Satan, and it is lodged in the house of hell accordingly."</p>
<p>A man once asked him what advice he should give to a friend whose wife
had left him for another, and who was in great sorrow for her loss. "You
shall bid him thank God," replied Rodaja, "for the favour he has
obtained, in that his enemy is removed from his house."</p>
<p>"Then you would not have him go seek her?" inquired the other.</p>
<p>"Let him not even think of doing so," returned Rodaja, "for if he find
her, what will he have gained but the perpetual evidence of his
dishonour?"</p>
<p>"And what shall I do to keep peace with my own wife?" inquired the same
person.</p>
<p>"Give her all that she can need or rightfully claim," said the maniac,
"and let her be mistress of every person and thing thy house contains,
but take care that she be not mistress of thyself."</p>
<p>A boy one day said to him, "Señor Glasscase, I have a mind to run away
from my father, and leave my home for ever, because he beats me." "I
would have thee beware, boy," replied Rodaja; "the stripes given by a
father are no dishonour to the son, and may save him from those of the
hangman, which are indeed a disgrace."</p>
<p>Intelligence of his peculiar state, with a description of the replies he
gave, and the remarks he uttered, was much spread abroad, more
especially among those who had known him in different parts, and great
sorrow was expressed for the loss of a man who had given so fair a
promise of distinction. A person of high rank then at Court wrote to a
friend of his at Salamanca, begging that Rodaja might be sent to him at
Valladolid, and charging his friend to make all needful arrangements for
that purpose. The gentleman consequently accosted Vidriera the next time
he met him, and said, "Señor Glasscase, you are to know that a great
noble of the Court is anxious to have you go to Valladolid;" whereupon
Rodaja replied, "Your worship will excuse me to that nobleman, and say
that I am not fit to dwell at Court, nor in the Palace, because I have
some sense of shame left, and do not know how to flatter." He was
nevertheless persuaded to go, and the mode in which he travelled was as
follows: a large pannier of that kind in which glass is transported was
prepared, and in this Rodaja was placed, well defended by straw, which
was brought up to his neck, the opposite pannier being carefully
balanced by means of stones, among which appeared the necks of bottles,
since Rodaja desired it to be understood that he was sent as a vessel of
glass. In this fashion he journeyed to Valladolid, which city he entered
by night, and was not unpacked until he had first been carefully
deposited in the house of the noble who had requested his presence.</p>
<p>By this gentleman he was received with much kindness, and the latter
said to him, "You are extremely welcome, Doctor Glasscase; I hope you
have had a pleasant journey." Rodaja replied, that no journey could be
called a bad one if it took you safe to your end, unless indeed it were
that which led to the gallows.</p>
<p>Being one day shown the Falconry, wherein were numerous falcons and
other birds of similar kind, he remarked that the sport pursued by means
of those birds was entirely suitable to great nobles, since the cost was
as two thousand to one of the profit.</p>
<p>When it pleased Rodaja to go forth into the city, the nobleman caused
him to be attended by a servant, whose office it was to protect him from
intrusion, and see that he was not molested by the boys of the place, by
whom he was at once remarked; indeed but few days had elapsed before he
became known to the whole city, since he never failed to find a reply
for all who questioned or consulted him.</p>
<p>Among those of the former class, there once came a student, who inquired
if he were a poet, to which Rodaja replied, that up to the moment they
had then arrived at, he had neither been so stupid nor so bold as to
become a poet. "I do not understand what you mean by so stupid or so
bold, Señor Glasscase," rejoined the student; to which Rodaja made
answer, "I am not so stupid as to be a bad poet, nor so bold as to think
myself capable of being a good one." The student then inquired in what
estimation he held poets, to which he answered that he held the poets
themselves in but little esteem; but as to their art, that he esteemed
greatly. His hearer inquiring further what he meant by that, Rodaja said
that among the innumerable poets, by courtesy so called, the number of
good ones was so small as scarcely to count at all, and that as the bad
were not true poets, he could not admire them: but that he admired and
even reverenced greatly the art of poetry, which does in fact comprise
every other in itself, since it avails itself of all things, and
purifies and beautifies all things, bringing its own marvellous
productions to light for the advantage, the delectation, and the wonder
of the world, which it fills with its benefits. He added further, "I
know thoroughly to what extent, and for what qualities, we ought to
estimate the good poet, since I perfectly well remember those verses of
Ovid, wherein he says:—</p>
