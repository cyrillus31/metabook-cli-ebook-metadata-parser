<p>Five leagues from the city of Seville there is a town called
Castelblanco. At one of the many inns belonging to that town there
arrived at nightfall a traveller, mounted on a handsome nag of foreign
breed. He had no servant with him, and, without waiting for any one to
hold his stirrup, he threw himself nimbly from the saddle. The host, who
was a thrifty, active man, quickly presented himself, but not until the
traveller had already seated himself on a bench under the gateway, where
the host found him hastily unbuttoning his breast, after which he let
his arms drop and fainted. The hostess, who was a good-natured soul,
made haste to sprinkle his face with cold water, and presently he
revived. Evidently ashamed of having been seen in such a state, he
buttoned himself up again, and asked for a room to which he might
retire, and, if possible, be alone. The hostess said they had only one
in the house and that had two beds, in one of which she must accommodate
any other guest that might arrive. The traveller replied that he would
pay for both beds, guest or no guest; and taking out a gold crown he
gave it to the hostess, on condition that no one should have the vacant
bed. The hostess, well satisfied with such good payment, promised that
she would do as he required, though the Dean of Seville himself should
arrive that night at her house. She then asked him if he would sup. He
declined, and only begged they would take great care of his nag. Then,
taking the key of the chamber, and carrying with him a large pair of
leathern saddle-bags, he went in, locked the door, and even, as it
afterwards appeared, barricaded it with two chairs.</p>
<p>The moment he was gone, the host, the hostess, the hostler, and two
neighbours who chanced to be there, held a council together, and all
extolled the great comeliness and graceful deportment of the stranger,
agreeing that they had never seen any one so handsome. They discussed
his age, and came to the conclusion that it was between sixteen and
seventeen. They speculated largely as to what might have been the cause
of his fainting, but could make no plausible guess at it. The neighbours
after a while went home, the host went to look after the nag, and the
hostess to prepare supper in case any other guest should arrive; nor was
it long before another entered, not much older than the first, and of no
less engaging mien, so that the hostess no sooner saw him than she
exclaimed, "God bless me! how is this? Are angels coming to stop here
to-night?"</p>
<p>"Why does the lady hostess say that?" said the cavalier.</p>
<p>"It is not for nothing I say it. Only I must beg your honour not to
dismount, for I have no bed to give you; for the two I had have been
taken by a cavalier who has paid for both, though he has no need of more
than one; but he does that because no one else may enter the room,
being, I suppose, fond of solitude; though upon my conscience I can't
tell why, for his face and appearance are not such that he need be
ashamed of them or want to hide them, but quite the contrary."</p>
<p>"Is he so good-looking, señora hostess?"</p>
<p>"Good-looking? Ay, the best of good-looking."</p>
<p>"Here, my man, hold my stirrup," said the cavalier to a muleteer who
accompanied him; "for though I have to sleep on the floor, I must see a
man of whom I hear such high encomiums;" and then dismounting he called
for supper, which was immediately placed before him. Presently an
alguazil dropped in—as they commonly do at the inns in small towns—and
taking a seat, entered into conversation with the cavalier while he
supped; not forgetting at intervals to swallow three large glasses of
wine, and the breast and leg of a partridge, which the cavalier gave
him. He paid his scot meanwhile by asking news of the capital, of the
wars in Flanders, and the decay of the Turk, not forgetting the exploits
of the Transylvanian, whom God preserve. The cavalier supped and said
nothing, not having come from a place which would have supplied him with
the means of satisfying these inquiries. By and by, the innkeeper,
having seen to the nag, came in and sat down to make a third in the
conversation, and to taste his own wine no less copiously than the
alguazil; and at every gulp he leaned his head back over his left
shoulder, and praised the wine, which he exalted to the clouds, though
he did not leave much of it there, for fear it should get watered.</p>
<p>From one subject to another, the host fell at last upon the praises of
the first comer; told how he had fainted, how he had gone to bed without
supper, and had locked himself in; and spoke of his well-filled
saddle-bags, the goodness of his nag, and the handsome travelling-dress
he wore, all which made it strange that he travelled without any
attendant. The cavalier felt his curiosity piqued anew, and asked the
landlord to contrive that he might sleep in the second bed, for which he
would give him a gold crown. The landlord's fingers itched to take the
money; but he said the thing was impossible, for the door was locked
inside, and he durst not wake the sleeper, who had paid so well for both
the beds. The alguazil, however, got over the difficulty. "I'll tell you
what is to be done," said he. "I will knock at the door, and say that I
am an officer of justice; that I have orders from the señor alcalde to
see this cavalier accommodated in this inn; and that as there is no
other bed, he must have one of those two. The landlord will cry out
against this, and say it is not fair, for the second bed is already
engaged and paid for; and so he will clear himself of all
responsibility, while your honour will attain your object." This scheme
of the alguazil's was unanimously approved, and the cavalier rewarded
him for it with four reals. It was carried into effect at once; the
first guest was compelled, with manifest reluctance, to open the door;
the second entered the room with many apologies for the intrusion, to
which the first made no reply, nor did he even show his face; for
instantly hastening back into bed, he turned to the wall, and pretended
to be asleep. The last comer also went to bed, hoping to have his
curiosity satisfied in the morning when they both got up.</p>
<p>The night was one of the long and weary ones of December, when the cold
and the fatigues of the day should naturally have disposed the two
travellers to sleep; but they had not that effect on the first of the
pair, who not long after midnight began to sigh and moan as if his heart
would break. His lamentations awoke the occupant of the other bed, who
distinctly overheard the following soliloquy, though uttered in a faint
and tremulous voice, broken by sighs and sobs.</p>
<p>"Wretch that I am! Whither is the irresistible force of my destiny
hurrying me? What a path is mine; and what issue can I hope for out of
the labyrinth in which I am entangled? O my youth and inexperience!
Honour disregarded! Love ungratefully repaid! Regard for honoured
parents and kindred trampled under foot! Woe is me a thousand times to
have thus given the reins to my inclinations! O false words which I have
too trustingly responded to by deeds! But of whom do I complain? Did I
not wilfully betray myself? Did not my own hands wield the knife that
cut down my reputation, and destroyed the trust which my parents reposed
in my rectitude? O perjured Marco Antonio! Is it possible that your
honeyed words concealed so much of the gall of unkindness and disdain?
Where art thou, ingrate? Whither hast thou fled, unthankful man? Answer
her who calls upon thee! Wait for her who pursues thee; sustain me, for
I droop; pay me what thou owest me; succour me since thou art in so many
ways bound to me!"</p>
<p>Here the sorrowing stranger relapsed into silence, broken only by sobs.
The other, who had been listening attentively, inferred from what he had
heard that the speaker was a woman. The curiosity he had before felt was
now excited to the highest degree: he was several times on the point of
approaching the lady's bed; and he would have done so at last, but just
then he heard her open the door, call to the landlord, and bid him
saddle the nag, for she wanted to go. It was a pretty long time before
she could make the landlord hear her; and finally, all the answer she
could obtain was a recommendation to go to sleep again, for there was
more than half the night yet to come, and it was so dark that it would
be a very rash thing to venture upon the road. Upon this she said no
more, but shut the door, and went back to bed, sighing dismally.</p>
<p>The other stranger now thought it would be well to address her, and
offer her his aid in any way that might be serviceable, as a means of
inducing her to say who she was, and relate her piteous story.
"Assuredly, señor gentleman," said he, "I should think myself destitute
of natural feeling—nay, that I had a heart of stone and a bosom of
brass—if your sighs and the words you have uttered did not move me to
sympathy. If the compassion I feel for you, and the earnest desire I
have conceived to risk my life for your relief—if your misfortunes
admit of any—may give me some claim upon your courtesy, I entreat you
to manifest it in declaring to me the cause of your grief without
reserve."</p>
<p>"If that grief had not deprived me of understanding," said the person
addressed, "I ought to have remembered that I was not alone in this
room, and have bridled my tongue and suppressed my sighs; but to punish
myself for my imprudent forgetfulness, I will do what you ask; for it
may be that the pangs it will cost me to relate the bitter story of my
misfortunes will end at once my life and my woes. But first you must
promise me solemnly, that whatever I may reveal, you will not quit your
bed nor come to mine, nor ask more of me than I choose to disclose; for
if you do, the very moment I hear you move I will run myself through
with my sword, which lies ready to my hand."</p>
<p>The cavalier, who would have promised anything to obtain the information
he so much desired, vowed that he would not depart a jot from the
conditions so courteously imposed. "On that assurance, then," said the
lady, "I will do what I have never done before, and relate to you the
history of my life. Hearken then.</p>
<p>"You must know, señor, that although I entered this inn, as they have
doubtless told you, in the dress of a man, I am an unhappy maiden, or at
least I was one not eight days ago, and ceased to be so, because I had
the folly to believe the delusive words of a perjured man. My name is
Teodosia; my birth-place is one of the chief towns of the province of
Andalusia, the name of which I suppress, because it does not import you
so much to know it as me to conceal it. My parents, who are noble and
wealthy, had a son and a daughter; the one for their joy and honour, the
other for the reverse. They sent my brother to study at Salamanca, and
me they kept at home, where they brought me up with all the scrupulous
care becoming their own virtue and nobility; whilst on my part I always
rendered them the most cheerful obedience, and punctually conformed to
all their wishes, until my unhappy fate set before my eyes the son of a
neighbour of ours, wealthier than my parents, and no less noble than
they. The first time I saw him, I felt nothing more than the pleasure
one feels at making an agreeable acquaintance; and this I might well
feel, for his person, air, manners, disposition, and understanding were
the admiration of all who knew him. But why dwell on the praises of my
enemy, or make so long a preface to the confession of my infatuation and
my ruin? Let me say at once that he saw me repeatedly from a window
opposite to mine; whence, as it seemed to me, he shot forth his soul
towards me from his eyes, whilst mine beheld him with a pleasure very
different from that which I had experienced at our first interview, and
one which constrained me to believe that everything I read in his face
was the pure truth.</p>
<p>"Seeing each other in this way led to conversation; he declared his
passion, and mine responded to it, with no misgiving of his sincerity,
for his suit was urged with promises, oaths, tears, sighs, and every
accompaniment that could make me believe in the reality of his devoted
attachment. Utterly inexperienced as I was, every word of his was a
cannon shot that breached the fortress of my honour; every tear was a
fire in which my virtue was consumed; every sigh was a rushing wind that
fanned the destructive flame. In fine, upon his promise to marry me in
spite of his parents, who had another wife in view for him, I forgot all
my maidenly reserve, and without knowing how, put myself into his power,
having no other witness of my folly than a page belonging to Marco
Antonio—for that is the name of the destroyer of my peace—who two days
afterwards disappeared from the neighbourhood, without any person, not
even his parents, having the least idea whither he was gone. In what
condition I was left, imagine if you can; it is beyond my power to
describe it.</p>
<p>"I tore my hair as if it was to blame for my fault, and punished my face
as thinking it the primary occasion of my ruin; I cursed my fate, and my
own precipitation; I shed an infinity of tears, and was almost choked by
them and by my sighs; I complained mutely to heaven, and pondered a
thousand expedients to see if there was any which might afford me help
or remedy, and that which I finally resolved on was to dress myself in
male apparel, and go in quest of this perfidious Æneas, this cruel and
perjured Bireno, this defrauder of my honest affections and my
legitimate and well-founded hopes. Having once formed this resolution, I
lost no time in putting it in execution. I put on a travelling suit
belonging to my brother, saddled one of my father's horses with my own
hand, and left home one very dark night, intending to go to Salamanca,
whither it was conjectured that Marco Antonio might have gone; for he
too is a student, and an intimate friend of my brother's. I did not omit
to take at the same time a quantity of gold sufficient for all
contingencies upon my journey. What most distresses me is the thought
that my parents will send in pursuit of me, and that I shall be
discovered by means of my dress and the horse; and even had I not this
to fear, I must dread my brother's resentment; for he is in Salamanca,
and should he discover me, I need not say how much my life would be in
peril. Even should he listen to my excuses, the least scruple of his
honour would outweigh them all.</p>
<p>"Happen what may, my fixed resolve is to seek out my heartless husband,
who cannot deny that he is my husband without belying the pledge which
he left in my possession—a diamond ring, with this legend: 'Marco
Antonio is the husband of Teodosia.' If I find him, I will know from him
what he discovered in me that prompted him so soon to leave me; and I
will make him fulfil his plighted troth, or I will prove as prompt to
vengeance as I was easy in suffering myself to be aggrieved, and will
take his life; for the noble blood that runs in my veins is not to be
insulted with impunity. This, señor cavalier, is the true and sad
history you desired to hear, and which you will accept as a sufficient
apology for the words and sighs that awoke you. What I would beseech of
you is, that though you may not be able to remedy my misfortune, at
least you may advise me how to escape the dangers that beset me, evade
being caught, and accomplish what I so much desire and need."</p>
<p>The cavalier said not a syllable in reply, and remained so long silent
that Teodosia supposed he was asleep and had not heard a word she had
been saying. To satisfy herself of this, she said, "Are you asleep,
señor? No wonder if you are; for a mournful tale poured into an
unimpassioned ear is more likely to induce drowsiness than pity."</p>
<p>"I am not asleep," replied the cavalier; "on the contrary, I am so
thoroughly awake, and feel so much for your calamity, that I know not if
your own anguish exceeds mine. For this reason I will not only give you
the advice you ask, but my personal aid to the utmost of my powers; for
though the manner in which you have told your tale proves that you are
gifted with no ordinary intelligence, and therefore that you have been
your own betrayer, and owe your sorrow to a perverted will rather than
to the seductions of Marco Antonio, nevertheless I would fain see your
excuse in your youth and your inexperience of the wily arts of men.
Compose yourself, señora, and sleep if you can during the short
remainder of the night. When daylight comes we will consult together,
and see what means may be devised for helping you out of your
affliction."</p>
<p>Teodosia thanked him warmly, and tried to keep still for a while in
order that the cavalier might sleep; but he could not close an eye; on
the contrary he began to toss himself about in the bed, and to heave
such deep sighs that Teodosia was constrained to ask him what was the
matter? was he suffering in any way, and could she do anything for his
relief?</p>
<p>"Though you are yourself the cause of my distress, señora," he replied,
"you are not the person who can relieve it, for if you were I should not
feel it."</p>
<p>Teodosia could not understand the drift of this perplexed reply; she
suspected, however, that he was under the influence of some amorous
passion, and even that she herself might be the object of it; for it
might well be that the fact of his being alone with one he knew to be a
woman, at that dead hour of the night, and in the same bed-room, should
have awakened in him some bad thoughts. Alarmed at the idea, she hastily
put on her clothes without noise, buckled on her sword and dagger, and
sat down on the bed to wait for daylight, which did not long delay to
appear through the many openings there were in the sides of the room, as
usual in inn-chambers. The cavalier on his part, had made ready exactly
as Teodosia had done; and he no sooner perceived the first rays of
light, than he started up from his bed, saying, "Get up, señora
Teodosia, and let us be gone; for I will accompany you on your journey,
and never quit your side until I see Marco Antonio become your lawful
husband, or until he or I shall be a dead man;" and so saying, he opened
the windows and the doors of the room.</p>
<p>Teodosia had longed for daylight that she might see what manner of man
he was with whom she had been conversing all night; but when she beheld
him, she would have been glad that it had never dawned, but that her
eyes had remained in perpetual darkness, for the cavalier who stood
before her was her brother! At sight of him she was stupefied with
emotion, her face was deadly pale, and she could not utter a word. At
last, rallying her spirits, she drew her dagger, and presenting the
handle to her brother, fell at his feet, and gasped out, "Take it, dear
señor and brother, punish the fault I have committed, and satisfy your
resentment, for my offence deserves no mercy, and I do not desire that
my repentance should be accepted as an atonement. The only thing I
entreat is that you will deprive me of life, but not of my honour; for
though I have placed it in manifest danger by absenting myself from the
house of my parents, yet its semblance may be preserved before the world
if my death be secret."</p>
<p>Her brother regarded her fixedly, and although her wantonness excited
him to vengeance, he could not withstand this affecting appeal. With a
placable countenance he raised her from the ground, and consoled her as
well as he could, telling her, among other things, that as he knew of no
punishment adequate to the magnitude of her folly, he would suspend the
consideration of that matter for the present; and as he thought that
fortune had not yet made all remedy impossible, he thought it bettor to
seek one than at once to take vengeance on her for her levity. These
words restored Teodosia to life; the colour returned to her cheeks, and
her despair gave way to revived hope. Don Rafael (that was the brother's
name) would speak no more on the subject, but bade her change her name
from Teodosia to Teodoro, and decided that they should both proceed at
once to Salamanca in quest of Marco Antonio, though he hardly expected
to find him there; for as they were intimate friends, they would have
met had he been at the university, unless indeed Marco Antonio might
have shunned him from a consciousness of the wrong he had done him. The
new Teodoro acquiesced in everything proposed by her brother; and the
innkeeper coming in, they ordered breakfast, intending to depart
immediately.</p>
<p>Before all was ready another traveller arrived. This was a gentleman who
was known to Don Rafael and Teodoro, and the latter, to avoid being
seen by him, remained in the chamber. Don Rafael, having embraced the
newcomer, asked him what news he brought. His friend replied that he had
just come from the port of Santa Maria, where he had left four galleys
bound for Naples, and that he had seen Marco Antonio Adorno, the son of
Don Leonardo Adorno, on board one of them. This intelligence rejoiced
Don Rafael, to whom it appeared that since he had so unexpectedly
learned what it was of such importance for him to know, he might regard
this an omen of his future success. He asked his friend, who knew his
father well, to exchange the hired mule he rode for his father's nag,
giving him to understand, not that he was coming from Salamanca, but
that he was going thither, and that he was unwilling to take so good an
animal on so long a journey. The other obligingly consented, and
promised to deliver the nag to its owner. Don Rafael and he breakfasted
together, and Teodoro alone; and finally the friend pursued his journey
to Cazallo, where he had an estate, whilst Don Rafael excused himself
from accompanying him by saying that he had to return that day to
Seville.</p>
<p>As soon as the friend was gone, and the reckoning paid, Don Rafael and
Teodoro mounted and bade adieu to the people of the inn, leaving them
all in admiration of the comeliness of the pair. Don Rafael told his
sister what news he had received of Marco Antonio, and that he proposed
they should make all haste to reach Barcelona; for vessels on their way
to or fro between Italy and Spain usually put in at that port; and if
Marco Antonio's ship had not yet arrived there, they would wait for it,
and be sure of seeing him. His sister said he should do as he thought
best, for his will was hers. Don Rafael then told the muleteer who
accompanied him to have patience, for he intended to go to Barcelona,
but would pay him accordingly. The muleteer, who was one of the merriest
fellows of his trade, and who knew Don Rafael's liberality, declared
that he was willing to go with him to the end of the world.</p>
<p>Don Rafael asked his sister what money she had. She told him she had not
counted it; all she knew was that she had put her hand seven or eight
times into her father's strong box, and had taken it out full of gold
crowns. From this Don Rafael calculated that she might have something
about five hundred crowns, which, with two hundred of his own, and a
gold chain he wore, seemed to him no bad provision for the journey; the
more so, as he felt confident of meeting Marco Antonio in Barcelona.
They pursued their journey I rapidly without accident or impediment
until they arrived within two leagues of a town called Igualada, which
is nine leagues from Barcelona, and there they learned that a cavalier
who was going as ambassador to Rome, was waiting at Barcelona for the
galleys, which had not yet arrived. Greatly cheered by this news, they
pushed on until they came to the verge of a small wood, from which they
saw a man running, and looking back over his shoulder with every
appearance of terror. "What is the matter with you, good man?" said Don
Rafael, going up to him. "What has happened to you, that you seem so
frightened and run so fast?"</p>
<p>"Have I not good cause to be frightened and to run fast," said the man,
"since I have escaped by a miracle from a gang of robbers in that wood?"</p>
<p>"Malediction! Lord save us!" exclaimed the muleteer. "Robbers at this
hour! By my halidom, they'll leave us as bare as we were born."</p>
<p>"Don't make yourself uneasy, brother," replied the man from the wood,
"for the robbers have by this time gone away, after leaving more than
thirty passengers stripped to their shirts and tied to trees, with the
exception of one only, whom they have left to unbind the rest as soon as
they should have passed a little hill they pointed out to him."</p>
<p>"If that be so," said Calvete, the muleteer, "we may proceed without
fear, for where the robbers have made an attack, they do not show
themselves again for some days. I say this with confidence, as a man who
has been twice in their hands, and knows all their ways."</p>
<p>This fact being confirmed by the stranger, Don Rafael resolved to go on.
They entered the wood, and had not advanced far, when they came upon the
persons who had been robbed, and who were more than forty in number. The
man who had been left free, had unbound some of them; but his work was
not yet complete, and several of them were still tied to the trees. They
presented a strange spectacle, some of them stripped naked, others
dressed in the tattered garments of the robbers; some weeping over their
disaster, some laughing at the strange figure the others made in their
robber's costume; one dolorously reciting the list of the things he had
lost, another declaring that the loss of a box of Agnus Dei he was
bringing home from Rome afflicted him more than all besides. In short,
the whole wood resounded with the moans and lamentations of the
despoiled wretches. The brother and sister beheld them with deep
compassion, and heartily thanked heaven for their own narrow escape from
so great a peril. But what affected Teodoro more than anything else was
the sight of a lad apparently about fifteen, tied to a tree, with no
covering on him but a shirt and a pair of linen drawers, but with a face
of such beauty that none could refrain from gazing on it. Teodoro
dismounted and unbound him, a favour which he acknowledged in very
courteous terms; and Teodoro, to make it the greater, begged Calvete to
lend the gentle youth his cloak, until he could buy him another at the
first town they came to. Calvete complied, and Teodoro threw the cloak
over his shoulders, asking him in Don Rafael's presence to what part of
the country he belonged, whence he was coming, and whither he was going.
The youth replied that he was from Andalusia, and he named as his
birthplace a town which was but two leagues distant from that of the
brother and sister. He said he was on his way from Seville to Italy, to
seek his fortune in arms like many another Spaniard; but that he had had
the misfortune to fall in with a gang of thieves, who had taken from him
a considerable sum of money and clothes, which he could not replace for
three hundred crowns. Nevertheless he intended to pursue his journey,
for he did not come of a race which was used to let the ardour of its
zeal evaporate at the first check.</p>
<p>The manner in which the youth expressed himself, the fact that he was
from their own neighbourhood, and above all, the letter of
recommendation he carried in his face, inspired the brother and sister
with a desire to befriend him as much as they could. After they had
distributed some money among such of the rest as seemed in most need of
it, especially among monks and priests, of whom there were eight, they
made this youth mount Calvete's mule, and went on without more delay to
Igualada. There they were informed that the galleys had arrived the day
before at Barcelona, whence they would sail in two days, unless the
insecurity of the roadstead compelled them to make an earlier departure.
On account of this news, they rose next morning before the sun, although
they had not slept all night in consequence of a circumstance which had
occurred at supper, and which had more surprised and interested the
brother and sister than they were themselves aware. As they sat at
table, and the youth with them whom they had taken under their
protection, Teodoro fixed her eyes intently on his face, and
scrutinising his features somewhat curiously, perceived that his ears
were bored. From this and from a certain bashfulness that appeared in
his looks, she suspected that the supposed youth was a woman, and she
longed for supper to be over that she might verify her suspicion.
Meanwhile Don Rafael asked him whose son he was, for he knew all the
principal people in the town he had named as his birth place. The youth
said he was the son of Don Enrique de Cardenas. Don Rafael replied that
he was well acquainted with Don Enrique, and knew for certain that he
had no son; but that if he had given that answer because he did not
choose to make known his family, it was of no consequence, and he should
not be questioned again on that subject.</p>
<p>"It is true," said the youth, "that Don Enrique has no children, but his
brother Don Sancho has."</p>
<p>"He has no son either," replied Don Rafael, "but an only daughter, who,
by the bye, they say is one of the handsomest damsels in Andalusia; but
this I know only by report; for though I have been often in her town I
have never seen her."</p>
<p>"It is quite true, as you say, señor, that Don Sancho has only a
daughter, but not one so handsome as fame reports; and if I said that I
was the son of Don Enrique it was only to give myself some importance in
your eyes; for in fact, I am only the son of Don Sancho's steward, who
has been many years in his service, and I was born in his house. Having
displeased my father, I carried off a good sum of money from him, and
resolved to go to Italy, as I have told you, and follow the career of
arms, by which men even of obscure birth have been known to make
themselves illustrious."</p>
<p>Teodoro, who listened attentively to all this conversation, was more and
more confirmed in her suspicion, both by the manner and the substance
of what the youth said. After the cloth was removed, and while Don
Rafael was preparing for bed, she made known to him her surmise, and
then, with his permission, took the youth aside, and, going out with him
upon a balcony which looked on the street, addressed him thus:—</p>
<p>"Don Francisco," for that was the name he had given himself, "I would
fain have done you so much service that you could not help granting me
anything that I should ask of you; but the short time we have known you
has not permitted this. Hereafter perhaps you may know how far I deserve
that you should comply with my desires; but if you do not choose to
satisfy that which I am now about to express, I will not the less
continue to be your faithful servant. Furthermore, before I prefer my
present request, I would impress upon you that although my age does
exceed yours, I have more experience of the world than is usual at my
years, as you will admit when I tell you that it has led me to suspect
that you are not a man, as your garb imports, but a woman, and one as
well-born as your beauty proclaims, and perhaps as unfortunate as your
disguise implies, for such transformations are never made willingly, or
except under the pressure of some painful necessity. If what I suspect
is the case, tell me so, and I swear to you on the faith of a cavalier
to aid and serve you in every way I can. That you are a woman you cannot
make me doubt, for the holes in your ears make that fact very clear. It
was thoughtless of you not to close them with a little flesh-coloured
wax, for somebody else as inquisitive as myself, and not so fit to be
trusted with a secret, might discover by means of them what you have so
ill concealed. Believe me, you need not hesitate to tell me who you are,
in full reliance on my inviolable secrecy."</p>
<p>The youth had listened with great attention to all Teodoro said, and,
before answering her a word, he seized her hands, carried them by force
to his lips, kissed them with great fervour, and even bedewed them
copiously with tears. Teodoro could not help sympathising with the acute
feelings of the youth, and shedding tears also. Although, when she had
with difficulty withdrawn her hands from the youth's lips, he replied
with a deep-drawn sigh, "I will not, and cannot deny, señora, that your
suspicion is true; I am a woman, and the most unfortunate of my sex;
and since the acts of kindness you have conferred upon me, and the
offers you make me, oblige me to obey all your commands, listen and I
will tell you who I am, if indeed it will not weary you to hear the tale
of another's misfortunes."</p>
<p>"May I never know aught else myself," replied Teodoro, "if I shall not
feel a pleasure in hearing of those misfortunes equal to the pain it
will give me to know that they are yours, and that will be such as if
they were my own." And again she embraced and encouraged the seeming
youth, who, somewhat more tranquilised, continued thus:—</p>
<p>"I have spoken the truth with regard to my native place, but not with
regard to my parents; for Don Enrique is not my father but my uncle, and
his brother Don Sancho is my father. I am that unhappy daughter of his
of whom your brother says that she is celebrated for her beauty, but how
mistakenly you now perceive. My name is Leocadia; the occasion of my
disguise you shall now hear.</p>
<p>"Two leagues from my native town there is another, one of the wealthiest
and noblest of Andalusia, where lives a cavalier of quality, who derives
his origin from the noble and ancient Adornos of Genoa. He has a son,
who, unless fame exaggerates his praises as it does mine, is one of the
most gallant gentlemen one would desire to see. Being so near a
neighbour of ours, and being like my father strongly addicted to the
chase, he often came on a visit of five or six days to our house, the
greater part of that time, much of the night even included, being spent
by my father and him in the field. From these visits of his, fortune, or
love, or my own imprudence, took occasion to bring me down to my present
state of degradation. Having observed, with more attention than became a
modest and well-behaved maiden, the graceful person and manners of our
visitor, and taking into consideration his distinguished lineage and the
great wealth of his parents, I thought that to obtain him for my husband
would be the highest felicity to which my wishes could aspire. With this
thought in my head I began to gaze at him most intently, and also, no
doubt, with too little caution, for he perceived it, and the traitor
needed no other hint to discover the secret of my bosom and rob me of my
peace. But why should I weary you by recapitulating every minute detail
of my unfortunate attachment? Let me say at once that he won so far
upon me by his ceaseless solicitations, having plighted his faith under
the most solemn and, as I thought, the most Christian vows that he would
become my husband, that I put myself wholly at his disposal.
Nevertheless, not being quite satisfied with his vows alone, and in
order that the wind might not bear them away, I made him commit them to
writing, and give them to me in a paper signed with his own hand, and
drawn up in terms so strong and unequivocal as to remove all my
mistrust. Once in possession of this paper, I arranged that he should
come to me one night, climb the garden-wall, and enter my chamber, where
he might securely pluck the fruit destined for him alone. The night so
longed for by me at last arrived—"</p>
<p>Up to this point Teodoro had listened with rapt attention, especially
since she had heard the name of Adorno, but now she could contain
herself no longer. "Well," she cried, suddenly interrupting the speaker,
"and then, what did he do? Did he keep the assignation? Were you happy
in his arms? Did he confirm his written pledge anew? Was he content when
he had obtained from you what you say was his? Did your father know it?
What was the end of this good and wise beginning?"</p>
<p>"The end was to bring me to what you see, for he never came."</p>
<p>Teodoro breathed again at these words, and partly recovered her
self-possession, which had been almost destroyed by the frantic
influence of jealousy. Even yet she was not so free from it but that she
trembled inwardly as Leocadia continued her story.</p>
<p>"Not only did he fail to keep the assignation, but a week after I
learned for certain that he had disappeared from home, and carried off
from the house of her parents, persons of distinction in his own
neighbourhood, a very beautiful and accomplished young lady named
Teodosia. I was nearly mad with jealousy and mortification. I pictured
Teodosia to myself in imagination, more beautiful than the sun, more
perfect than perfection itself, and above all, more blissful than I was
miserable. I read the written engagement over and over again; it was as
binding as any form of words could be; but though my hopes would fain
have clung to it as something sacred and inviolable, they all fell to
the ground when I remembered in what company Marco Antonio had departed.
I beat my face, tore my hair, and cursed my fate; but what was most
irksome to me was that I could not practise these self-inflictions at
all hours in consequence of my father's presence. In fine, that I might
be free to indulge my woe without impediment, I resolved to quit my
home. It would seem that the execution of a bad purpose never fails for
want of opportunity. I boldly purloined a suit of clothes belonging to
one of my father's pages, and from himself a considerable sum of money;
then leaving the house by night I travelled some leagues on foot, and
reached a town called Osuna, where I hired a car. Two days afterwards I
entered Seville, where I was quite safe from all pursuit.</p>
<p>"There I bought other clothes, and a mule, and set out with some
cavaliers who were travelling with all speed to Barcelona, that they
might be in time for some galleys that were on their way to Italy. I
continued my journey until yesterday, when the robbers took everything
from me, and among the rest, that precious thing which sustained my soul
and lightened my toils, the written engagement given me by Marco
Antonio. I had intended to carry it with me to Italy, find Marco Antonio
there, and present it to him as an evidence of his faithlessness and my
constancy, and constrain him to fulfil his promise. At the same time I
am conscious that he may readily deny the words written on this paper,
since he has made nought of the obligations that should have been
engraved on his soul; besides, it is plain that if he is accompanied by
the incomparable Teodosia he will not deign to look upon the unfortunate
Leocadia. But happen what may, I am resolved to die or present myself
before the pair, that the sight of me may trouble their joy. This
Teodosia, this enemy of my peace, shall not so cheaply enjoy what is
mine. I will seek her out, I will find her, and will take her life if I
can."</p>
<p>"But how is Teodosia in fault," said Teodoro, "if, as is very probably
the case, she too has been deluded by Marco Antonio, as you, señora,
have been?"</p>
<p>"How can that be so," returned Leocadia, "if he has her with him? Being
with the man she loves, what question can there be of delusion? They are
together, and therefore they are happy, and would be so, though they
were in the burning deserts of Lybia, or the dreary wastes of Scythia.
She is blest in his arms wherever she is, and therefore she shall pay
for all I shall suffer till I find her."</p>
<p>"It is very likely you are mistaken," said Teodoro; "I am very well
acquainted with this enemy of yours, as you call her, and I know her
prudence and modesty to be such, that she never would venture to quit
her father's house and go away with Marco Antonio. And even had she done
so, not knowing you, nor being aware of any claim you had on him, she
has not wronged you at all, and where there is no wrong, vengeance is
out of place."</p>
<p>"Tell me not of her modesty, señor; for I was as modest and as virtuous
as any maiden in the world, and yet I have done what I have told you.
That he has carried her off there is no doubt. I acknowledge, looking on
the matter dispassionately, that she has not wronged me; but the pangs
of jealousy which she occasions me make me abhor her. If a sword were
thrust through my vitals, should I not naturally strive to pluck it out
and break it to pieces?"</p>
<p>"Well, well, señora Leocadia, since the passion that sways you makes you
speak so wildly, I see it is not the fit time to offer you rational
advice. I shall therefore content myself with repeating that I am ready
and willing to render you every service in my power, and I know my
brother's generous nature so well, that I can boldly make you the same
promise on his part. We are going to Italy, and it rests only with
yourself to accompany us. One thing only I entreat, that you will allow
me to tell my brother what I know of your story, that he may treat you
with the attention and respect which is your due. I think you had better
continue to wear male attire, and if it is to be procured in this place,
I will take care that you shall be suitably equipped to morrow. For the
rest, trust to time, for it is a great provider of remedies even for the
most desperate cases."</p>
<p>Leocadia gratefully thanked the generous Teodoro, saying he might tell
his brother whatever he thought fit, and beseeching him not to forsake
her, since he saw to what dangers she was exposed, if she was known to
be a woman. Here the conversation ended, and they retired to rest,
Teodosia in her brother's room, and Leocadia in another next it. Don
Rafael was still awake, waiting for his sister to know what had passed
between her and the suspected woman; and before she lay down, he made
her relate the whole to him in detail. "Well, sister," he said when she
had finished, "if she is the person she declares herself to be, she
belongs to the best family in her native place, and is one of the
noblest ladies of Andalusia. Her father is well known to ours, and the
fame of her beauty perfectly corresponds with the evidence of our own
eyes. My opinion is, that we must proceed with caution, lest she come to
speak with Marco Antonio before us, for I feel some uneasiness about
that written engagement she speaks of, even though she has lost it. But
be of good cheer, sister, and go to rest, for all will come right at
last."</p>
<p>Teodosia complied with her brother's advice so far as to go to bed, but
it was impossible for her to rest, so racked was she by jealous fears.
Oh, how she exaggerated the beauty of Leocadia, and the disloyalty of
Marco Antonio! How often she read with the eyes of her imagination his
written promise to her rival! What words and phrases she added to it, to
make it more sure and binding! How often she refused to believe that it
was lost! And how many a time she repeated to herself, that even though
it were lost, Marco Antonio would not the less fulfil his promise to
Leocadia, without thinking of that by which he was bound to herself! In
such thoughts as these she passed the night without a wink of sleep; nor
was her brother Don Rafael less wakeful; for no sooner had he heard who
Leocadia was, than his heart was on fire for her. He beheld her in
imagination, not tied to a tree, or in tattered male garments, but in
her own rich apparel in her wealthy father's house. He would not suffer
his mind to dwell on that which was the primary cause of his having
become acquainted with her; and he longed for day that he might continue
his journey and find out Marco Antonio, not so much that he might make
him his brother-in-law, as that he might hinder him from becoming the
husband of Leocadia. In fact, he was so possessed by love and jealousy,
that he could have borne to see his sister comfortless, and Marco
Antonio fairly buried, rather than be himself without hope of obtaining
Leocadia.</p>
<p>Thus with different thoughts, they all quitted their beds at break of
day, and Don Rafael sent for the host, and asked him if he could
purchase a suit of clothes in that place for a page who had been
stripped by robbers. The host said he happened to have one for sale
which he would dispose of at a reasonable price. He produced it,
Leocadia found that it fitted her very well, she put it on, and girt
herself with sword and dagger with such sprightly grace that she
enchanted Don Rafael, and redoubled Teodosia's jealousy. Calvete saddled
the mules, and about eight in the morning, they started for Barcelona,
not intending to take the famous monastery of Monserrate on their way,
but to visit it on a future occasion, whenever it might please God to
send them home again with hearts more at ease.</p>
<p>Words are not adequate to describe the feelings of the two brothers, or
with what different eyes they severally regarded Leocadia; Teodosia
wishing for her death, and Don Rafael for her life; Teodosia striving to
find faults in her, in order that she might not despair of her own
hopes; and Don Rafael finding out new perfections, that more and more
obliged him to love her. All these thoughts, however, did not hinder
their speed, for they reached Barcelona before sunset. They admired the
magnificent situation of the city, and esteemed it to be the flower of
the world, the honour of Spain, the terror of all enemies near and far,
the delight of its inhabitants, the refuge of strangers, the school of
chivalry, the model of loyalty, in a word, a union of all that a
judicious curiosity could desire in a grand, famous, wealthy, and
well-built city. Upon their entering it they heard a great uproar, and
saw a multitude of people running with loud cries. They inquired the
cause, and were told that the people of the galleys in the port had
fallen upon those of the town. Don Rafael desired to see what was going
on, though Calvete would have dissuaded him; for, as the muleteer said,
he knew well what mischief came of interfering in such frays as this,
which usually occurred in Barcelona when galleys put in there.</p>
<p>In spite of this good advice, Don Rafael and his fellow-travellers went
down at once towards the beach, where they saw many swords drawn, and
numbers of people slashing at each other without mercy, and they
approached so near the scene without dismounting, that they could
distinctly see the faces of the combatants, for the sun was still above
the horizon. The number of townspeople engaged was immense, and great
crowds issued from the galleys, although their commander, Don Pedro
Vique, a gentleman of Valencia, stood on the prow of the flag-ship,
threatening all who entered the boats to succour their comrades. Finding
his commands disregarded, he ordered a gun to be fired without ball, as
a warning that if the combatants did not separate, the next gun he fired
would be shotted. Meanwhile, Don Rafael, who narrowly watched the fray,
observed among those who took part with the seamen a young man of about
two-and-twenty, dressed in green, with a hat of the same colour, adorned
with a rich loop and buttons apparently of diamonds. The skill and
courage with which he fought, and the elegance of his dress, drew upon
him the attention of all the spectators, and Teodosia and Leocadia both
cried out, as if with one voice, "Good heavens! either my eyes deceive
me, or he in green is Marco Antonio." Then, with great nimbleness, they
dismounted, drew their swords and daggers, cleared their way through the
crowd, and placed themselves one on each side of Marco Antonio. "Fear
nothing, Señor Marco Antonio," cried Leocadia, "for there is one by your
side who will defend your life at the cost of his own." "Who doubts it,"
ejaculated Teodosia, on the other side, "since I am here?" Don Rafael,
who had seen and heard all this, followed his two companions, and took
sides as they did.</p>
<p>Marco Antonio was too busy smiting and defending himself to heed what
his two seconds had said; he could think of nothing but fighting, and no
man ever fought more bravely; but as the party of the town was every
moment increasing in numbers, the people of the galleys were forced to
retreat and take to the water. Marco Antonio retreated with the rest,
much against his will, still attended on either side by his two valiant
Amazons. By this time a Catalonian knight of the renowned House of
Cardonas, made his appearance on a noble charger, and, throwing himself
between the two parties, ordered the townspeople to retire. The majority
obeyed, but some still continued to fling stones, one of which unluckily
struck Marco Antonio on the breast with such force that he fell
senseless into the water, in which he was wading up to his knees.
Leocadia instantly raised and supported him in her arms, and Teodosia
aided her.</p>
<p>Don Rafael, who had turned aside a little to avoid a shower of stones,
saw the accident which had befallen Marco Antonio, and was hastening
forward to his aid, when the Catalonian knight stopped him, saying,
"Stay, señor, and do me the favour to put yourself by my side. I will
secure you from the insolence of this unruly rabble."</p>
<p>"Ah, señor!" replied Rafael, "let me pass, for I see that in great
danger which I most love in this world."</p>
<p>The knight let him pass, but before he could reach the spot, the crew of
the flagship's boat had already taken on board Marco Antonio and
Leocadia, who never let him out of her arms. As for Teodosia, whether it
was that she was weary, or overcome with grief to see her lover wounded,
or enraged with jealousy to see her rival with him, she had not strength
to get into the boat, and would certainly have fallen in a fainting fit
into the water, if her brother had not opportunely come to her aid,
while he himself felt no less torment than his sister at seeing Leocadia
go away with Marco Antonio.</p>
<p>The Catalonian knight being very much taken with the goodly presence of
Don Rafael and his sister (whom he supposed to be a man), called them
from the shore, and requested them to go with him, and they were
constrained to accept his friendly offer, lest they should suffer some
injury from the people, who were not yet pacified. Thereupon, the knight
dismounted, and with his drawn sword in his hand, led them through the
tumultuous throng, who made way at his command. Don Rafael looked round
to see if he could discover Calvete with the mules; but he was not to be
seen, for the moment his employers dismounted, he had gone off to an inn
where he had lodged on previous occasions. On their arrival at the
knight's abode, which was one of the principal houses in the city, he
asked them in which of the galleys they had arrived. Don Rafael replied
that they had not come in any, for they had arrived in the city just as
the fray began; and it was because they had recognised the gentleman who
was wounded with a stone that they had involved themselves in danger.
Moreover, he entreated the knight would have the gentleman brought on
shore, as he was one on whom his own dearest interests depended. "I will
do so with great pleasure," replied the knight, "and I am sure the
general will allow it, for he is a worthy gentleman and a relation of
mine." Thereupon he went at once to the galley, where he found Marco
Antonio under the hands of the surgeon, who pronounced his wound
dangerous, being near the heart. With the general's consent he had him
brought on shore with great care, accompanied by Leocadia, and carried
to his own house in a litter, where he entertained the whole party with
great hospitality.</p>
<p>A famous surgeon of the city was now sent for, but he would not touch
the patient's wound until the following day, alleging that it had no
doubt been properly treated already, army and navy surgeons being always
men of skill, in consequence of their continual experience in cases of
wounds. He only desired that the patient should be placed in a quiet
room and left to rest. Presently the surgeon of the galley arrived, and
had a conference with his colleague, who approved of what he had done,
and agreed with him in thinking the case highly dangerous. Leocadia and
Teodosia heard this with as much anguish of heart as if it had been a
sentence of death upon themselves; but not wishing to betray their
grief, they strove to conceal it in silence. Leocadia, however,
determined to do what she thought requisite for her honour, and as soon
as the surgeons were gone, she entered Marco Antonio's room, where,
going up to his bed side, and taking his hand in presence of the master
of the house, Don Rafael, Teodosia, and others, "Señor Marco Antonio
Adorno," she said, "it is now no seasonable time, considering your
condition, to utter many words; and therefore I shall only entreat you
to lend your ear to some few which concern, if not the safety of your
body, at least that of your soul. But I must have your permission to
speak; for it would ill become me, who have striven never to disoblige
you from the first moment I knew you, to disturb you now in what seems
almost your last."</p>
<p>At these words Marco Antonio opened his eyes, looked steadfastly at
Leocadia, and recognising her rather by the tone of her voice than by
her face, said with a feeble voice, like one in pain, "Say on, señor,
what you please, for I am not so far gone but that I can listen to you;
nor is that voice of yours so harsh and unpleasing that I should dislike
to hear it."</p>
<p>Teodosia hearkened most attentively, and every word that Leocadia spoke
pierced her heart like an arrow, and at the same time harrowed the soul
of Don Rafael. "If the blow you have received," continued Leocadia, "or
rather that which has struck my heart, has not effaced from your memory,
señor Marco Antonio, the image of her whom not long ago you called your
glory and your heaven, you must surely call to mind who Leocadia was,
and what was the promise you gave her in writing under your own hand;
nor can you have forgotten the worth of her parents, her own modesty and
virtue, and the obligation you are under to her for having always
gratified you in everything you desired. If you have not forgotten all
this, you may readily know, in spite of this disguise, that I am
Leocadia. As soon as I heard of your departure from home, dreading lest
new chances and opportunities should deprive me of what is so justly
mine, I resolved, in defiance of the worst miseries, to follow you in
this garb, and to search the wide world over till I found you. Nor need
you wonder at this, if you have ever felt what the strength of true love
is capable of, or know the frenzy of a deceived woman. I have suffered
some hardships in my quest, all of which I regard as pastime since they
have resulted in my seeing you; for, though you are in this condition,
if it be God's will to remove you to a better world, I shall esteem
myself more than happy if before your departure you do what becomes you,
in which case I promise you to live in such a manner after your death
that I shall soon follow you on that last inevitable journey. I beseech
you then, for the love of heaven, for your own honour, and for my sake,
to whom you owe more than to all the world, receive me at once as your
lawful wife, not leaving it to the law to do what you have so many
righteous motives for doing of your own accord."</p>
<p>Here Leocadia ceased speaking. All present had listened to her in
profound silence, and in the same way they awaited the reply of Marco
Antonio. "I cannot deny, señora," he said, "that I know you; your voice
and your face will not suffer me to do that. Nor yet can I deny how much
I owe to you, nor the great worth of your parents and your own
incomparable modesty and virtue. I do not, and never shall, think
lightly of you for what you have done in coming to seek me in such a
disguise; on the contrary, I shall always esteem you for it in the
highest degree. But since, as you say, I am so near my end, I desire to
make known to you a truth, the knowledge of which, if it be unpleasant
to you now, may hereafter be useful to you.</p>
<p>"I confess, fair Leocadia, that I loved you, and you loved me; and yet I
confess also that my written promise was given more in compliance with
your desire than my own; for before I had long signed it my heart was
captivated by a lady named Teodosia, whom you know, and whose parentage
is as noble as your own. If I gave you a promise signed with my hand, to
her I gave that hand itself in so unequivocal a manner that it is
impossible for me to bestow it on any other person in the world. My
amour with you was but a pastime from which I culled only some flowers,
leaving you nothing the worse; from her I obtained the consummate fruit
of love upon my plighted faith to be her husband. That I afterwards
deserted you both was the inconsiderate act of a young man who thought
that all such things were of little importance, and might be done
without scruple. My intention was to go to Italy, and after spending
some of the years of my youth there, to return and see what had become
of you and my real wife; but Heaven in its mercy, as I truly believe,
has permitted me to be brought to the state in which you see me, in
order that in thus confessing my great faults, I may fulfil my last duty
in this world, by leaving you disabused and free, and ratifying on my
deathbed the pledge I gave to Teodosia. If there is anything, señora
Leocadia, in which I can serve you during the short time that remains to
me, let me know it; so it be not to receive you as my wife, for that I
cannot, there is nothing else which I will not do, if it be in my power,
to please you."</p>
<p>Marco Antonio, who had raised himself on one arm while he spoke, now
fell back senseless. Don Rafael then came forward. "Recover yourself,
dear señor," he said, embracing him affectionately, "and embrace your
friend and your brother, since such you desire him to be."</p>
<p>Marco Antonio opened his eyes, and recognising Don Rafael, embraced him
with great warmth. "Dear brother and señor," he said, "the extreme joy I
feel in seeing you must needs be followed by a proportionate affliction,
since, as they say, after gladness comes sorrow; but whatever befals me
now I will receive with pleasure in exchange for the happiness of
beholding you."</p>
<p>"To make your happiness more complete," replied Don Rafael, "I present
to you this jewel as your own." Then, turning to look for his sister, he
found her behind the rest of the people in the room, bathed in tears,
and divided between joy and grief at what she saw and what she had
heard. Taking her by the hand, her brother led her passively to the
bed-side, and presented her to Marco Antonio, who embraced her with
loving tears.</p>
<p>The rest of those present stared in each others' faces in speechless
amazement at these extraordinary occurrences; but the hapless Leocadia,
seeing her whom she had mistaken for Don Rafael's brother locked in the
arms of him she looked on as her own husband, and all her hopes mocked
and ruined, stole out of the room unperceived by the others, whose
attention was engrossed by the scene about the bed. She rushed wildly
into the street, intending to wander over the world, no matter whither;
but she was hardly out of doors before Don Rafael missed her, and, as if
he had lost his soul, began to inquire anxiously after her; but nobody
could tell what had become of her. He hastened in dismay to the inn
where he was told Calvete lodged, thinking she might have gone thither
to procure a mule; but, not finding her there, he ran like a madman
through the streets, seeking her in every quarter, till the thought
struck him that she might have made for the galleys, and he turned in
that direction. As he approached the shore he heard some one calling
from the land for the boat belonging to the general's galley, and soon
recognised the voice as that of the beautiful Leocadia. Hearing his
footsteps as he hastened towards her, she drew her sword and stood upon
her guard; but perceiving it was Don Rafael, she was vexed and confused
at his having found her, especially in so lonely a place; for she was
aware, from many indications, that he was far from regarding her with
indifference; on the contrary, she would have been delighted to know
that Marco Antonio loved her as well. How shall I relate all that Don
Rafael now said to Leocadia? I can give but a faint idea of the glowing
language in which he poured out his soul.</p>
<p>"Were it my fate, beautiful Leocadia," he said, "along with the favours
of fortune to lack also at this moment the courage to disclose to you
the secret of my soul, then would there be doomed to perpetual oblivion
the most ardent and genuine affection that ever was harboured in a
lover's breast. But not to do it that wrong, I will make bold, señora,
come of it what may, to beg you will observe, if your wounded feelings
allow you, that in nothing has Marco Antonio the advantage of me, except
the happiness of being loved by you. My lineage is as good as his, and
in fortune he is not much superior to me. As for the gifts of nature, it
becomes me not to laud myself, especially if in your eyes those which
have fallen to my share are of no esteem. All this I say, adored señora,
that you may seize the remedy for your disasters which fortune offers to
your hand. You see that Marco Antonio cannot be yours, since Heaven has
already made him my sister's; and the same Heaven which has taken him
from you is now willing to compensate you with me, who desire no higher
bliss in this life than that of being your husband. See how good fortune
stands knocking at the door of the evil fortune you have hitherto known.
And do not suppose that I shall ever think the worse of you for the
boldness you have shown in seeking after Marco Antonio; for from the
moment I determine to match myself with you, I am bound to forget all
that is past. Well I know that the same power which has constrained me
so irresistibly to adore you, has brought you also to your present pass,
and therefore there will be no need to seek an excuse where there has
been no fault."</p>
<p>Leocadia listened in silence to all Don Rafael said, only from time to
time heaving a sigh from the bottom of her heart. Don Rafael ventured to
take her hand; she did not withdraw it; and kissing it again and again,
he said, "Tell me, lady of my soul, that you will be so wholly, in
presence of these starry heavens, this calm listening sea, and these
watery sands. Say that <i>yes</i>, which surely behoves your honour as well
as my happiness. I repeat to you that I am a gentleman, as you know, and
wealthy; that I love you, which you ought to esteem above every other
consideration; and that whereas I find you alone, in a garb that
derogates much from your honour, far from the home of your parents and
your kindred, without any one to aid you at your need, and without the
hope of obtaining what you were in quest of, you may return home in your
own proper and seemly garb, accompanied by as good a husband as you had
chosen for yourself, and be wealthy, happy, esteemed, and even applauded
by all who may become acquainted with the events of your story. All
this being so, I know not why you hesitate. Say the one word that shall
raise me from the depth of wretchedness to the heaven of bliss, and in
so doing, you will do what is best for yourself; you will comply with
the demands of courtesy and good sense, and show yourself at once
grateful and discreet."</p>
<p>"Well," said the doubting Leocadia, at last, "since Heaven has so
ordained, and neither I nor any one living can oppose its will, be it as
Heaven and you desire, señor. I take the same power to witness with what
bashfulness I consent to your wishes, not because I am unconscious of
what I gain by complying with them, but because I fear that when I am
yours you will regard me with other eyes than those with which hitherto
perhaps you have mistakingly beheld me. But be it as it may, to be the
lawful wife of Don Rafael de Villavicencio is an honour I cannot lose,
and with that alone I shall live contented. But if my conduct after I am
your wife give me any claim to your esteem, I will thank Heaven for
having brought me through such strange circumstances and such great
misfortunes to the happiness of being yours. Give me your hand, Don
Rafael, and take mine in exchange; and, as you say, let the witnesses of
our mutual engagement be the sky, the sea, the sands, and this silence,
interrupted only by my sighs and your entreaties."</p>
<p>So saying, she permitted Don Rafael to embrace her, and taking each
other's hand they solemnised their betrothal with a few tears drawn from
their eyes by the excess of joy succeeding to their past sorrows. They
immediately returned to the knight's house, where their absence had
occasioned great anxiety, and where the nuptials of Marco Antonio and
Teodosia had already been celebrated by a priest, at the instance of
Teodosia, who dreaded lest any untoward chance should rob her of her
new-found hopes. The appearance of Don Rafael and Leocadia, and the
account given by the former of what had passed between them, augmented
the general joy, and the master of the house rejoiced as if they were
his own near relations; for it is an innate characteristic of the
Catalonian gentry to feel and act as friends towards such strangers as
have any need of their services.</p>
<p>The priest, who was still present, desired that Leocadia should change
her dress for one appropriate to her sex, and the knight at once
supplied both the ladies with handsome apparel from the wardrobe of his
wife, who was a lady of the ancient house of the Granolliques, famous in
that kingdom. The surgeon was moved by charity to complain that the
wounded man talked so much and was not left alone; but it pleased God
that Marco Antonio's joy, and the little silence he observed, were the
very means of his amendment, so that when they came to dress his wound
next day, they found him out of danger, and in a fortnight more he was
fit to travel. During the time he kept his bed he had made a vow that if
he recovered he would go on a pilgrimage on foot to Santiago de Galicia,
and in the fulfilment of that vow he was accompanied by Don Rafael,
Leocadia, Teodosia, and even by the muleteer Calvete, unusual as such
pious practices are with men of his calling; but he had found Don Rafael
so liberal and good-humoured that he would not quit him till he had
returned home. The party having to travel on foot as pilgrims, the mules
were sent on to Salamanca.</p>
<p>The day fixed for their departure arrived, and equipped in their
dalmaticas and with all things requisite, they took leave of their
generous and hospitable friend, the knight Don Sancho de Cardona, a man
of most illustrious blood and personally famous; and they pledged
themselves that they and their descendants, to whom they should bequeath
it as a duty, should perpetually preserve the memory of the singular
favours received from him, in order that they might not be wanting at
least in grateful feeling, if they could not repay them in any other
way. Don Sancho embraced them all, and said it was a matter of course
with him to render such services or others to all whom he knew or
supposed to be Castilian hidalgos. They repeated their embraces twice,
and departed with gladness, mingled with some sorrow. Travelling by easy
stages to suit the strength of the lady pilgrims, they reached
Monserrate in three days, remained as many more there, fulfilling their
duties as good Catholic Christians, and resuming their journey, arrived
without accident at Santiago, where they accomplished their vows with
all possible devotion. They determined not to quit their pilgrim garbs
until they reached their homes. After travelling towards them leisurely,
they came at last to a rising ground whence Leocadia and Teodosia
looked down upon their respective birth-places, nor could they restrain
their tears at the glad sight which brought back to their recollection
all their past vicissitudes.</p>
<p>From the same spot they discovered a broad valley, which divided the two
townships, and in it they saw under the shades of an olive a stalwart
knight, mounted on a powerful charger, armed with a strong keen lance
and a dazzlingly white shield. Presently they saw issuing from among
some olive trees two other knights similarly armed, and of no less
gallant appearance. These two rode up to the first, and after remaining
awhile together they separated. The first knight and one of the two
others set spurs to their horses, and charging each other like mortal
enemies, began mutually to deal such vigorous thrusts, and to avoid or
parry them with such dexterity, that it was plain they were masters in
that exercise. The third knight remained a spectator of the fight
without quitting his place. Don Rafael, who could not be content with a
distant view of the gallant conflict, hurried down the hill, followed by
the other three, and came up close to the two champions just as they had
both been slightly wounded. The helmet of one of them had fallen off,
and as he turned his face towards Don Rafael, the latter recognised his
father, and Marco Antonio knew that the other was his own, whilst
Leocadia discovered hers in the third knight who had not fought.
Astounded at this spectacle, the two brothers instantly rushed between
the champions, crying out "Stop, cavaliers! Stop! We who call on you to
do so are your own sons! Father, I am Marco Antonio, for whose sake, as
I guess, your honoured life is put to this peril. Allay your anger; cast
away your weapons, or turn them against another enemy; for the one
before you must henceforth be your brother."</p>
<p>The two knights instantly stopped; and looking round they observed that
Don Sancho had dismounted and was embracing his daughter, who briefly
narrated to him the occurrences at Barcelona. Don Sancho was proceeding
to make peace between the combatants, but there was no need of that, for
he found them already dismounted and embracing their sons with tears of
joy. There now appeared at the entrance of the valley a great number of
armed men on foot and on horseback: these were the vassals of the three
knights, who had come to support the cause of their respective lords;
but when they saw them embracing the pilgrims they halted, and knew not
what to think until Don Sancho briefly recounted to them what he had
learned from his daughter. The joy of all was unbounded. Five of the
vassals immediately mounted the pilgrims on their own horses, and the
whole party set out for the house of Marco Antonio's father, where it
was arranged that the two weddings should be celebrated. On the way Don
Rafael and Marco Antonio learned that the cause of the quarrel which had
been so happily ended was a challenge sent to the father of the latter
by the fathers of Teodosia and Leocadia, under the belief that he had
been privy to the acts of seduction committed by his son. The two
challengers having found him alone would not take any advantage of him,
but agreed to fight him one after the other, like brave and generous
knights. The combat, nevertheless, must have ended in the death of one
or all of them but for the timely arrival of their children, who gave
thanks to God for so happy a termination of the dispute.</p>
<p>The day after the arrival of the pilgrims, Marco Antonio's father
celebrated the marriages of his son and Teodosia, Don Rafael and
Leocadia, with extraordinary magnificence. The two wedded pairs lived
long and happily together, leaving an illustrious progeny which still
exists in their two towns, which are among the best in Andalusia. Their
names, however, we suppress, in deference to the two ladies, whom
malicious or prudish tongues might reproach with levity of conduct. But
I would beg of all such to forbear their sentence, until they have
examined themselves and seen whether they too have not been assailed
some time or other by what are called the arrows of Cupid, weapons whose
force is truly irresistible. Calvete was made happy with the gift of the
mule which Don Rafael had left at Salamanca, and with many other
presents; and the poets of the time took occasion to employ their pens
in celebrating the beauty and the adventures of the two damsels, as bold
as they were virtuous, the heroines of this strange story.</p>
