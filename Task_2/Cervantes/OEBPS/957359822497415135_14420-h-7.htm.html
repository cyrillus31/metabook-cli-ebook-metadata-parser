<p>Preciosa having finished this oracular descant for the lady of the
house, the rest of the company were all eager to have their fortunes
told likewise, but she put them off till the next Friday, when they
promised to have silver coin ready for crossing their palms. The señor
lieutenant now came in, and heard a glowing account of the charms and
accomplishments of the leading gitana. Having made her and her
companions dance a little, he emphatically confirmed the encomiums
bestowed on Preciosa; and putting his hand in his pocket he groped and
rummaged about in it for a while, but at last drew his hand out empty,
saying, "Upon my life I have not a doit. Give Preciosa a real, Doña
Clara; I will give it you by and by."</p>
<p>"That is all very well, señor," the lady replied; "but where is the real
to come from? Amongst us all we could not find a quarto to cross our
hands with."</p>
<p>"Well, give her some trinket or another, that Preciosa may come another
day to see us, when we will treat her better."</p>
<p>"No," said Doña Clara, "I will give her nothing to-day, and I shall be
sure she will come again."</p>
<p>"On the contrary," said Preciosa, "if you give me nothing. I will never
come here any more. Sell justice, señor lieutenant, sell justice, and
then you will have money. Do not introduce new customs, but do as other
magistrates do, or you will die of hunger. Look you, señor, I have heard
say that money enough may be made of one's office to pay any mulets that
may be incurred,<a id="FNanchor_70_70"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-8.htm.html#Footnote_70_70" class="pginternal"><sup>[70]</sup></a> and to help one to other appointments."</p>
<p>"So say and do those who have no conscience," said the lieutenant; "but
the judge who does his duty will have no mulet to pay; and to have well
discharged his office, will be his best help to obtain another."</p>
<p>"Your worship speaks like a very saint," replied Preciosa; "proceed
thus, and we shall snip pieces off your old coats for relics."</p>
<p>"You know a great deal, Preciosa," said the lieutenant; "say no more,
and I will contrive that their majesties shall see you, for you are fit
to be shown to a king."</p>
<p>"They will want me for a court fool," said the gitanilla, "and as I
never shall learn the trade, your pains will be all for nothing. If they
wanted me for my cleverness, they might have me; but in some palaces
fools thrive better than the wise. I am content to be a gitana, and
poor, and let Heaven dispose of me as it pleases."</p>
<p>"Come along, niña," said the old gipsy; "say no more, you have said a
great deal already, and know more than I ever taught you. Don't put too
fine a point to your wit for fear it should get blunted; speak of things
suitable to your years; and don't set yourself on the high ropes, lest
you should chance to have a fall."</p>
<p>"The deuce is in these gitanas," said the delighted lieutenant, as they
were taking their leave. The doncella of the thimble stopped them for a
moment, saying to Preciosa, "Tell me my fortune, or give me back my
thimble, for I have not another to work with."</p>
<p>"Señora doncella," replied Preciosa, "count upon your fortune as if it
were already told, and provide yourself with another; or else sew no
more gussets until I come again on Friday, when I will tell you more
fortunes and adventures than you could read in any book of knight
errantry."</p>
<p>The gipsies went away, and falling in with numerous workwomen returning
from Madrid to their villages as usual at the Ave Maria, they joined
company with them, as they always did for the greater security; for the
old gipsy lived in perpetual terror lest some one should run away with
her granddaughter.</p>
<p>One morning after this as they were returning to Madrid to levy black
mail along with other gitanas, in a little valley about five hundred
yards from the city, they met a handsome young gentleman richly dressed;
his sword and dagger were a blazo of gold; his hat was looped with a
jewelled band, and was adorned with plumes of various colours. The
gitanas stopped on seeing him, and set themselves to observe his
movements at their leisure, wondering much that so fine a cavalier
should be alone and on foot in such a place at that early hour. He came
up to them, and addressing the eldest gitana, said, "On your life,
friend, I entreat you do me the favour to let me say two words in
private to you and Preciosa. It shall be for your good."</p>
<p>"With all my heart," said the old woman, "so you do not take us much out
of our way, or delay us long;" and calling Preciosa, they withdrew to
some twenty paces distance, where they stopped, and the young gentleman
thus addressed them: "I am so subdued by the wit and beauty of Preciosa,
that after having in vain endeavoured to overcome my admiration, I have
at last found the effort impossible. I, señoras (for I shall always give
you that title if heaven favours my pretensions), am a knight, as this
dress may show you;" and opening his cloak he displayed the insignia of
one of the highest orders in Spain; "I am the son of——" (here he
mentioned a personage whose name we suppress for obvious reasons), "and
am still under tutelage and command. I am an only son, and expect to
inherit a considerable estate. My father is here in the capital, looking
for a certain post which by all accounts he is on the point of
obtaining. Being then of the rank and condition which I have declared to
you, I should yet wish to be a great lord for the sake of Preciosa, that
I might raise her up to my own level, and make her my equal and my lady.
I do not seek to deceive; the love I bear her is too deep for any kind
of deception; I only desire to serve her in whatever way shall be most
agreeable to her; her will is mine; for her my heart is wax to be
moulded as she pleases but enduring as marble to retain whatever
impression she shall make upon it. If you believe me I shall fear no
discouragement from any other quarter, but if you doubt me, I shall
despond. My name is——; my father's I have already given you; he lives
in such a house in such a street and you may inquire about him and me of
the neighbours, and of others also; for our name and quality are not so
obscure but that you may hear of us about the court, and every, where in
the capital. I have here a hundred crowns in gold to present to you, as
earnest of what I mean to give you hereafter; for a man will be no
niggard of his wealth who has given away his very soul."</p>
<p>Whilst the cavalier was speaking, Preciosa watched him attentively, and
doubtless she saw nothing to dislike either in his language or his
person. Turning to the old woman, she said, "Pardon me, grandmother, if
I take the liberty of answering this enamoured señor myself."</p>
<p>"Make whatever answer you please, granddaughter," said the old woman,
"for I know you have sense enough for anything." So Preciosa began.</p>
<p>"Señor cavalier," she said, "though I am but a poor gitana and humbly
born, yet I have a certain fantastic little spirit within me, which
moves me to great things. Promises do not tempt me, nor presents sap my
resolution, nor obsequiousness allure, nor amorous wiles ensnare me; and
although by my grandmother's reckoning I shall be but fifteen next
Michaelmas, I am already old in thought, and have more understanding
than my years would seem to promise. This may, perhaps, be more from
nature than from experience; but be that as it may, I know that the
passion of love is an impetuous impulse, which violently distorts the
current of the will, makes it dash furiously against all impediments,
and recklessly pursue the desired object. But not unfrequently when the
lover believes himself on the point of gaining the heaven of his wishes,
he falls into the hell of disappointment. Or say that the object is
obtained, the lover soon becomes wearied of his so much desired
treasure, and opening the eyes of his understanding he finds that what
before was so devoutly adored is now become abhorrent to him. The fear
of such a result inspires me with so great a distrust, that I put no
faith in words, and doubt many deeds. One sole jewel I have, which I
prize more than life, and that is my virgin purity, which I will not
sell for promises or gifts, for sold it would be in that case, and if it
could be bought, small indeed would be its value. Nor is it to be
filched from me by wiles or artifices; rather will I carry it with me to
my grave, and perhaps to heaven, than expose it to danger by listening
to specious tales and chimeras. It is a flower which nothing should be
allowed to sully, even in imagination if it be possible. Nip the rose
from the spray, and how soon it fades! One touches it, another smells
it, a third plucks its leaves, and at last the flower perishes in vulgar
hands. If you are come then, señor, for this booty, you shall never bear
it away except bound in the ties of wedlock. If you desire to be my
spouse, I will be yours; but first there are many conditions to be
fulfilled, and many points to be ascertained.</p>
<p>"In the first place I must know if you are the person you declare
yourself to be. Next, should I find this to be true, you must
straightway quit your father's mansion, and exchange it for our tents,
where, assuming the garb of a gipsy, you must pass two years in our
schools, during which I shall be able to satisfy myself as to your
disposition, and you will become acquainted with mine. At the end of
that period, if you are pleased with me and I with you, I will give
myself up to you as your wife; but till then I will be your sister and
your humble servant, and nothing more. Consider, señor, that during the
time of this novitiate you may recover your sight, which now seems lost,
or at least disordered, and that you may then see fit to shun what now
you pursue with so much ardour. You will then be glad to regain your
lost liberty, and having done so, you may by sincere repentance obtain
pardon of your family for your faults. If on these conditions you are
willing to enlist in our ranks, the matter rests in your own hands; but
if you fail in any one of them, you shall not touch a finger of mine."</p>
<p>The youth was astounded at Preciosa's decision, and remained as if
spell-bound, with his eyes bent on the ground, apparently considering
what answer he should return. Seeing this, Preciosa said to him, "This
is not a matter of such light moment that it can or ought to be
resolved on the spot. Return, señor, to the city, consider maturely what
is best for you to do; and you may speak with me in this same place any
week-day you please, as we are on our way to or from Madrid."</p>
<p>"When Heaven disposed me to love you, Preciosa," replied the cavalier,
"I determined to do for you whatever it might be your will to require of
me, though it never entered my thoughts that you would make such a
demand as you have now done; but since it is your pleasure that I should
comply with it, count me henceforth as a gipsy, and put me to all the
trials you desire, you will always find me the same towards you as I now
profess myself. Fix the time when you will have me change my garb. I
will leave my family under pretext of going to Flanders, and will bring
with me money for my support for some time. In about eight days I shall
be able to arrange for my departure, and I will contrive some means to
get rid of my attendants, so as to be free to accomplish my purpose.
What I would beg of you (if I might make bold to ask any favour) is
that, except to-day for the purpose of inquiring about me and my family,
you go no more to Madrid, for I would not that any of the numerous
occasions that present themselves there, should deprive me of the good
fortune I prize so dearly."</p>
<p>"Not so, señor gallant," said Preciosa: "wherever I go I must be free
and unfettered; my liberty must not be restrained or encumbered by
jealousy. Be assured, however, that I will not use it to such excess,
but that any one may see from a mile off that my honesty is equal to my
freedom. The first charge, therefore, I have to impose upon you is, that
you put implicit confidence in me; for lovers who begin by being
jealous, are either silly or deficient in confidence."</p>
<p>"You must have Satan himself within you, little one," said the old
gipsy; "why you talk like a bachelor of Salamanca. You know all about
love and jealousy and confidence. How is this? You make me look like a
fool, and I stand listening to you as to a person possessed, who talks
Latin without knowing it."</p>
<p>"Hold your peace, grandmother," replied Preciosa; "and know that all the
things you have heard me say are mere trifles to the many greater truths
that remain in my breast."</p>
<p>All that Preciosa said, and the sound sense she displayed, added fuel
to the flame that burned in the breast of the enamoured cavalier.
Finally, it was arranged that they should meet in the same place on that
day sennight, when he would report how matters stood with him, and they
would have had time to inquire into the truth of what he had told them.
The young gentleman then took out a brocaded purse in which he said
there were a hundred gold crowns, and gave it to the old woman; but
Preciosa would by no means consent that she should take them.</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue, niña," said her grandmother; "the best proof this
señor has given of his submission, is in thus having yielded up his arms
to us in token of surrender. To give, upon whatever occasion it may be,
is always the sign of a generous heart. Moreover, I do not choose that
the gitanas should lose, through my fault, the reputation they have had
for long ages of being greedy of lucre. Would you have me lose a hundred
crowns, Preciosa? A hundred crowns in gold that one may stitch up in the
hem of a petticoat not worth two reals, and keep them there as one holds
a rent-charge on the pastures of Estramadura! Suppose that any of our
children, grandchildren, or relations should fall by any mischance into
the hands of justice, is there any eloquence so sure to touch the ears
of the judge as the music of these crowns when they fall into his purse?
Three times, for three different offences, I have seen myself all but
mounted on the ass to be whipped; but once I got myself off by means of
a silver mug, another time by a pearl necklace, and the third time with
the help of forty pieces of eight, which I exchanged for quartos,
throwing twenty reals into the bargain. Look you, niña, ours is a very
perilous occupation, full of risks and accidents; and there is no
defence that affords us more ready shelter and succour than the
invincible arms of the great Philip: nothing beats the <i>plus ultra</i>.<a id="FNanchor_71_71"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-8.htm.html#Footnote_71_71" class="pginternal"><sup>[71]</sup></a>
For the two faces of a doubloon, a smile comes over the grim visage of
the procurator and of all the other ministers of mischief, who are
downright harpies to us poor gitanas, and have more mercy for highway
robbers than for our poor hides. Let us be ever so ragged and wretched
in appearance, they will not believe that we are poor, but say that we
are like the doublets of the gavachos of Belmont, ragged and greasy and
full of doubloons."</p>
<p>"Say no more, for heaven's sake, grandmother," said Preciosa; "do not
string together so many arguments for keeping the money, but keep it,
and much good may it do you. I wish to God you would bury it in a grave
out of which it may never return to the light, and that there may never
be any need of it. We must, however, give some of it to these companions
of ours, who must be tired of waiting so long for us."</p>
<p>"They shall see one coin out of this purse as soon as they will see the
Grand Turk," the old woman replied. "The good señor will try if he has
any silver coin or a few coppers remaining, to divide amongst them, for
they will be content with a little."</p>
<p>"Yes, I have," he said, and he took from his pocket three pieces of
eight which he divided among the gitanas, with which they were more
delighted than the manager of a theatre when he is placarded as victor
in a contest with a rival. Finally it was settled that the party should
meet there again in a week, as before mentioned, and that the young
man's gipsy name should be Andrew Caballero, for that was a surname not
unknown among the gipsies. Andrew (as we shall henceforth call him)
could not find courage to embrace Preciosa, but darting his very soul
into her with a glance, he went away without it, so to speak, and
returned to Madrid. The gipsies followed soon after; and Preciosa, who
already felt a certain interest in the handsome and amiable Andrew, was
anxious to learn if he was really what he said.</p>
<p>They had not gone far before they met the page of the verses and the
gold crown. "Welcome, Preciosa," he said, coming up to her. "Have you
read the lines I gave you the other day?"</p>
<p>"Before I answer you a word," said she, "you must, by all you love best,
tell me one thing truly."</p>
<p>"Upon that adjuration," he replied, "I could not refuse an answer to any
question, though it should cost me my head."</p>
<p>"Well, then, what I want to know is this: are you, perchance, a poet?"</p>
<p>"If I were one, it would certainly be perchance," said the page; "but
you must know, Preciosa, that the name of poet is one which very few
deserve. Thus I am not a poet, but only a lover of poetry; yet for my
own use I do not borrow of others. The verses I gave you were mine, as
are these also which I give you now; but I am not a poet for all
that—God forbid."</p>
<p>"Is it such a bad thing to be a poet?" Preciosa asked.</p>
<p>"It is not a bad thing," he answered; "but to be a poet and nothing else
I do not hold to be very good. We should use poetry like a rich jewel,
the owner of which does not wear it every day, or show it to all people,
but displays it only at suitable times. Poetry is a beautiful maiden,
chaste, honest, discreet, reserved, and never overstepping the limits of
perfect refinement. She is fond of solitude; she finds pleasure and
recreation among fountains, meadows, trees, and flowers; and she
delights and instructs all who are conversant with her."</p>
<p>"I have heard for all that," said Preciosa, "that she is exceedingly
poor; something of a beggar in short."</p>
<p>"It is rather the reverse," said the page, "for there is no poet who is
not rich, since they all live content with their condition; and that is
a piece of philosophy which few understand. But what has moved you,
Preciosa, to make this inquiry?"</p>
<p>"I was moved to it, because, as I believe all poets, or most of them, to
be poor, that crown which you gave me wrapped up with the verses caused
me some surprise; but now that I know that you are not a poet, but only
a lover of poetry, it may be that you are rich, though I doubt it, for
your propensity is likely to make you run through all you have got. It
is a well-known saying, that no poet can either keep or make a fortune."</p>
<p>"But the saying is not applicable to me," said the page. "I make verses,
and I am neither rich nor poor; and without feeling it or making a talk
about it, as the Genoese do of their invitations, I can afford to give a
crown, or even two, to whom I like. Take then, precious pearl, this
second paper, and this second crown enclosed in it, without troubling
yourself with the question whether I am a poet or not. I only beg you to
think and believe that he who gives you this would fain have the wealth
of Midas to bestow upon you."</p>
<p>Preciosa took the paper, and feeling a crown within it, she said, "This
paper bids fair to live long, for it has two souls within it, that of
the crown and that of the verses, which, of course, are full of souls
and hearts as usual. But please to understand, Señor Page, that I do not
want so many souls; and that unless you take back one of them, I will
not receive the other on any account. I like you as a poet and not as a
giver of gifts; and thus we may be the longer friends, for your stock of
crowns may run out sooner than your verses."</p>
<p>"Well," said the page, "since you will have it that I am poor, do not
reject the soul I present to you in this paper, and give me back the
crown, which, since it has been touched by your hand, shall remain with
me as a hallowed relic as long as I live."</p>
<p>Preciosa gave him the crown, and kept the paper, but would not read it
in the street. The page went away exulting in the belief that Preciosa's
heart was touched, since she had treated him with such affability.</p>
<p>It being now her object to find the house of Andrew's father, she went
straight to the street, which she well knew, without stopping anywhere
to dance. About half way down it, she saw the gilded iron balcony which
Andrew had mentioned to her, and in it a gentleman of about fifty years
of age, of noble presence, with a red cross on his breast. This
gentleman seeing the gitanilla, called out, "Come up here, niñas, and we
will give you something." These words brought three other gentlemen to
the balcony, among whom was the enamoured Andrew. The instant he cast
his eyes on Preciosa he changed colour, and well nigh swooned, such was
the effect her sudden appearance had upon him. The girls went up stairs,
whilst the old woman remained below to pump the servants with respect to
Andrew. As they entered the room, the elder gentleman was saying to the
others, "This is no doubt the handsome gitanilla who is so much talked
of in Madrid."</p>
<p>"It is," said Andrew; "and she is unquestionably the most beautiful
creature that ever was seen."</p>
<p>"So they say," said Preciosa, who had overheard these remarks as she
came in; "but indeed they must be half out in the reckoning. I believe I
am pretty well, but as handsome as they say—not a bit of it!"</p>
<p>"By the life of Don Juanico, my son," said the elder gentleman, "you are
far more so, fair gitana."</p>
<p>"And who is Don Juanico, your son?" said Preciosa.</p>
<p>"That gallant by your side," said the cavalier.</p>
<p>"Truly, I thought your worship had sworn by some bantling of two years
old," said Preciosa. "What a pretty little pet of a Don Juanico!<a id="FNanchor_72_72"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-8.htm.html#Footnote_72_72" class="pginternal"><sup>[72]</sup></a> Why
he is old enough to be married; and by certain lines on his forehead, I
foresee that married he will be before three years are out, and much to
his liking too, if in the meantime he be neither lost nor changed."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay," said one of the company; "the gitanilla can tell the meaning
of a wrinkle."</p>
<p>During this time, the three gipsy girls, who accompanied Preciosa, had
got their heads together and were whispering each other. "Girls," said
Christina, "that is the gentleman that gave us the three pieces of eight
this morning."</p>
<p>"Sure enough," said they; "but don't let us say a word about it unless
he mentions it. How do we know but he may wish to keep it secret?"</p>
<p>Whilst the three were thus conferring together, Preciosa replied to the
last remark about wrinkles. "What I see with my eyes, I divine with my
fingers. Of the Señor Don Juanico, I know without lines that he is
somewhat amorous, impetuous, and hasty; and a great promiser of things
that seem impossible. God grant he be not a deceiver, which would be
worse than all. He is now about to make a long journey; but the bay
horse thinks one thing, and the man that saddles him thinks another
thing. Man proposes and God disposes. Perhaps he may think he is bound
for Oñez, and will find himself on the way to Gaviboa."</p>
<p>"In truth, gitana," said Don Juan, "you have guessed right respecting me
in several points. I certainly intend, with God's will, to set out for
Flanders in four or five days, though you forebode that I shall have to
turn out of my road; yet I hope no obstacle will occur to frustrate my
purpose."</p>
<p>"Say no more, señorito," the gipsy replied; "but commend yourself to
God, and all will be well. Be assured I know nothing at all of what I
have been saying. It is no wonder if I sometimes hit the mark, since I
talk so much and always at random. I wish I could speak to such good
purpose as to persuade you not to leave home, but remain quietly with
your parents to comfort their old age; for I am no friend to these
Flanders expeditions, especially for a youth of your tender years. Wait
till you are grown a little more and better able to bear the toils of
war; and the rather as you have war enough at home, considering all the
amorous conflicts that are raging in your bosom. Gently, gently with
you, madcap! Look what you are doing before you marry; and now give us a
little dole for God's sake and for the name you bear; for truly I
believe you are well born, and if along with this you are loyal and
true, then I will sing jubilee for having hit the mark in all I have
said to you."</p>
<p>"I told you before, niña," said Don Juan, otherwise Andrew Caballero,
"that you were right on every point except as to the fear you entertain
that I am not quite a man of my word. In that respect you are certainly
mistaken. The word that I pledge in the field I fulfil in the town, or
wherever I may be, without waiting to be asked; for no man can esteem
himself a gentleman, who yields in the least to the vice of falsehood.
My father will give you alms for God's sake and for mine; for in truth I
gave all I had this morning to some ladies, of whom I would not venture
to assert that they are as obliging as they are beautiful, one of them
especially."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Christina said to her companions, "May I be hanged, girls,
if he is not talking of the three pieces of eight he gave us this
morning."</p>
<p>"No, that can't be," one of them observed; "for he said they were
ladies, and we are none; and being so true-spoken as he says he is, he
would not lie in this matter."</p>
<p>"Oh, but," said Christina, "that is not a lie of any moment that is told
without injury to anybody, but for the advantage and credit of him who
tells it. Be that as it may, I see he neither gives us anything, nor
asks us to dance."</p>
<p>The old gipsy now came into the room and said, "Make haste,
granddaughter; for it is late, and there is much to be done, and more to
be said."</p>
<p>"What is it, grandmother?" said Preciosa, "A boy or a girl?"</p>
<p>"A boy, and a very fine one. Come along, Preciosa, and you shall hear
marvels."</p>
<p>"God grant the mother does not die of her after pains," said the
granddaughter.</p>
<p>"We will take all possible care of her. She has had a very good time,
and the child is a perfect beauty."</p>
<p>"Has any lady been confined?" said Andrew's father.</p>
<p>"Yes, señor," replied the old Gitana: "but it is such a secret, that no
one knows of it except Preciosa, myself, and one other person. So we
cannot mention the lady's name."</p>
<p>"Well, we don't want to know it," said one of the gentlemen present;
"but God help the lady who trusts her secret to your tongues, and her
honour to your aid."</p>
<p>"We are not all bad," replied Preciosa; "perhaps there may be one among
us who piques herself on being as trusty and as true as the noblest man
in this room. Let us begone, grandmother; for here we are held in little
esteem, though in truth we are neither thieves nor beggars."</p>
<p>"Do not be angry, Preciosa," said Andrew's father. "Of you at least I
imagine no one can presume anything ill, for your good looks are warrant
for your good conduct. Do me the favour to dance a little with your
companions. I have here a doubloon for you with two faces, and neither
of them as good as your own, though they are the faces of two kings."</p>
<p>The moment the old woman heard this she cried, "Come along, girls: tuck
up your skirts, and oblige these gentlemen." Preciosa took the
tambourine, and they all danced with so much grace and freedom, that the
eyes of all the spectators were riveted upon their steps, especially
those of Andrew, who gazed upon Preciosa as if his whole soul was
centred in her; but an untoward accident turned his delight into
anguish. In the exertion of the dance, Preciosa let fall the paper given
her by the page. It was immediately picked up by the gentleman who had
no good opinion of the gipsies. He opened it, and said, "What have we
here? A madrigal? Good! Break off the dance, and listen to it; for, as
far as I can judge from the beginning, it is really not bad." Preciosa
was annoyed at this, as she did not know the contents of the paper; and
she begged the gentleman not to read it, but give it back to her. All
her entreaties, however, only made Andrew more eager to hear the lines,
and his friend read them out as follows:—</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Who hath Preciosa seen<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">Dancing like the Fairy Queen?<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">Ripplets on a sunlit river<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">Like her small feet glance and quiver.<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">When she strikes the timbrel featly,<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">When she warbles, oh how sweetly!<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">Pearls from her white hands she showers,<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">From her rosy lips drop flowers.<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">Not a ringlet of her hair<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">But doth thousand souls ensnare.<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">Not a glance of her bright eyes<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">But seems shot from Love's own skies.<br/>
</span>
<span>He in obeisance to this sovereign maid,<br/>
</span>
<span>His bow and quiver at her feet hath laid.<br/>
</span>
</div></div>
<p>"Por dios!" exclaimed the reader, "he is a dainty poet who wrote this."</p>
<p>"He is not a poet, señor," said Preciosa, "but a page, and a very
gallant and worthy man."</p>
<p>"Mind what you say, Preciosa," returned the other; "for the praises you
bestow on the page are so many lance-thrusts through Andrew's heart.
Look at him as he sits aghast, thrown back on his chair, with a cold
perspiration breaking through all his pores. Do not imagine, maiden,
that he loves you so lightly but that the least slight from you
distracts him. Go to him, for God's sake, and whisper a few words in his
ear, that may go straight to his heart, and recall him to himself. Go on
receiving such madrigals as this every day, and just see what will come
of it."</p>
<p>It was just as he had said. Andrew had been racked by a thousand
jealousies on hearing the verses; and was so overcome that his father
observed it, and cried out, "What ails you, Don Juan? You are turned
quite pale, and look as if you were going to faint."</p>
<p>"Wait a moment," said Preciosa, "let me whisper certain words in his
ear, and you will see that he will not faint." Then bending over him she
said, almost without moving her lips, "A pretty sort of gitano you will
make! Why, Andrew, how will you be able to bear the torture with
gauze,<a id="FNanchor_73_73"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-8.htm.html#Footnote_73_73" class="pginternal"><sup>[73]</sup></a> when you are overcome by a bit of paper?" Then making
half-a-dozen signs of the cross over his heart, she left him, after
which Andrew breathed a little, and told his friends that Preciosa's
words had done him good.</p>
<p>Finally, the two-faced doubloon was given to Preciosa, who told her
companions that she would change it, and share the amount honourably
with them. Andrew's father intreated her to leave him in writing the
words she had spoken to his son, as he wished by all means to know them.
She said she would repeat them with great pleasure; and that though they
might appear to be mere child's play, they were of sovereign virtue to
preserve from the heartache and dizziness of the head. The words were
these:—</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Silly pate, silly pate,<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">Why run on at this rate?<br/>
</span>
<span>No tripping, or slipping, or sliding!<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">Have trusty assurance,<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">And patient endurance<br/>
</span>
<span>And ever be frank and confiding.<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">To ugly suspicion<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">Refuse all admission,<br/>
</span>
<span>Nor let it your better sense twist over.<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">All this if you do<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">You'll not rue,<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">For excellent things will ensue,<br/>
</span>
<span>With the good help of God and St. Christopher.<br/>
</span>
</div></div>
<p>"Only say these words," she continued, "over any person who has a
swimming in the head, making at the same time six signs of the cross
over his heart, and he will soon be as sound as an apple."</p>
<p>When the old woman heard the charm, she was amazed at the clever trick
played by her granddaughter; and Andrew was still more so when he found
that the whole was an invention of her quick wit. Preciosa left the
madrigal in the hands of the gentleman, not liking to ask for it, lest
she should again distress Andrew; for she knew, without any one teaching
her, what it was to make a lover feel the pangs of jealousy. Before she
took her leave, she said to Don Juan, "Every day of the week, señor, is
lucky for beginning a journey: not one of them is black. Hasten your
departure, therefore, as much as you can; for there lies before you a
free life of ample range and great enjoyment, if you choose to
accommodate yourself to it."</p>
<p>"It strikes me that a soldier's life is not so free as you say,"
replied Andrew, "but one of submission rather than liberty. However, I
will see what I can do."</p>
<p>"You will see more than you think for," said Preciosa; "and may God have
you in his keeping, and lead you to happiness, as your goodly presence
deserves."</p>
<p>These farewell words filled Andrew with delight; the gitanas went away
no less gratified, and shared the doubloon between them, the old woman
as usual taking a part and a half, both by reason of her seniority, as
because she was the compass by which they steered their course on the
wide sea of their dances, pleasantry, and tricks.</p>
<p>At last the appointed day of meeting came, and Andrew arrived in the
morning at the old trysting place, mounted on a hired mule, and without
any attendant. He found Preciosa and her grandmother waiting for him,
and was cordially welcomed by them. He begged they would take him at
once to the rancho,<a id="FNanchor_74_74"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-8.htm.html#Footnote_74_74" class="pginternal"><sup>[74]</sup></a> before it was broad day, that he might not be
recognised should he be sought for. The two gitanas, who had taken the
precaution to come alone, immediately wheeled round, and soon arrived
with him at their huts. Andrew entered one of them, which was the
largest in the rancho, where he was forthwith assisted by ten or twelve
gitanos, all handsome strapping young fellows, whom the old woman had
previously informed respecting the new comrade who was about to join
them. She had not thought it necessary, to enjoin them to secrecy; for,
as we have already said, they habitually observed it with unexampled
sagacity and strictness. Their eyes were at once on the mule, and said
one of them, "We can sell this on Thursday in Toledo."</p>
<p>"By no means," said Andrew; "for there is not a hired mule in Madrid, or
any other town, but is known to all the muleteers that tramp the roads
of Spain."</p>
<p>"Por dios, Señor Andrew," said one of the gang, "if there were more
signs and tokens upon the mule than are to precede the day of judgment,
we will transform it in such a manner that it could not be known by the
mother that bore it, or the master that owned it."</p>
<p>"That maybe," said Andrew; "but for this time you must do as I
recommend. This mule must be killed, and buried where its bones shall
never be seen."</p>
<p>"Put the innocent creature to death!" cried another gipsy. "What a sin!
Don't say the word, good Andrew; only do one thing. Examine the beast
well, till you have got all its marks well by heart; then let me take it
away, and if in two hours from this time you are able to know, it again,
let me be basted like a runaway negro."</p>
<p>"I must insist upon the mule's being put to death," said Andrew, "though
I were ever so sure of its transformation. I am in fear of being
discovered unless it is put under ground. If you object for sake of the
profit to be made by selling it, I am not come so destitute to this
fraternity but that I can pay my footing with more than the price of
four mules."</p>
<p>"Well, since the Señor Andrew Caballero will have it so," said the other
gitano, "let the sinless creature die, though God knows how much it goes
against me, both because of its youth, for it has not yet lost mark of
mouth, a rare thing among hired mules, and because it must be a good
goer, for it has neither scars on its flank nor marks of the spur."</p>
<p>The slaughter of the mule was postponed till night, and the rest of the
day was spent in the ceremonies of Andrew's initiation. They cleared out
one of the best huts in the encampment, dressed it with boughs and
rushes, and seating Andrew in it on the stump of a cork tree, they put a
hammer and tongs in his hands, and made him cut two capers to the sound
of two guitars. They then bared one of his arms, tied round it a new
silk ribbon through which they passed a short stick, and gave it two
turns gently, after the manner of the garotte with which criminals are
strangled. Preciosa was present at all this, as were many other gitanas,
old and young, some of whom gazed at Andrew with admiration, others with
love, and such was his good humour, that even the gitanos took most
kindly to him.</p>
<p>These ceremonies being ended, an old gipsy took Preciosa by the hand,
and setting her opposite Andrew, spoke thus: "This girl, who is the
flower and cream of all beauty among the gitanas of Spain, we give to
you either for your wife or your mistress, for in that respect you may
do whatever shall be most to your liking, since our free and easy life
is not subject to squeamish scruples or to much ceremony. Look at her
well, and see if she suits you, or if there is anything in her you
dislike; if there is, choose from among the maidens here present the one
you like best, and we will give her to you. But bear in mind that once
your choice is made, you must not quit it for another, nor make or
meddle either with the married women or the maids. We are strict
observers of the law of good fellowship; none among us covets the good
that belongs to another. We live free and secure from the bitter plague
of jealousy; and though incest is frequent amongst us there is no
adultery. If a wife or a mistress is unfaithful, we do not go ask the
courts of justice to punish; but we ourselves are the judges and
executioners of our wives and mistresses, and make no more ado about
killing and burying them in the mountains and desert places than if they
were vermin. There are no relations to avenge them, no parents to call
us to account for their deaths. By reason of this fear and dread, our
women learn to live chaste; and we, as I have said, feel no uneasiness
about their virtue.</p>
<p>"We have few things which are not common to us all, except wives and
mistresses, each of whom we require to be his alone to whom fortune has
allotted her. Among us divorce takes place, because of old age as well
as by death. Any man may if he likes leave a woman who is too old for
him, and choose one more suitable to his years. By means of these and
other laws and statutes we contrive to lead a merry life. We are lords
of the plains, the corn fields, the woods, mountains, springs, and
rivers. The mountains yield us wood for nothing, the orchards fruit, the
vineyards grapes, the gardens vegetables, the fountains water, the
rivers fish, the parks feathered game; the rocks yield us shade, the
glades and valleys fresh air, and the caves shelter. For us the
inclemencies of the weather are zephyrs, the snow refreshment, the rain
baths, the thunder music, and the lightning torches. For us the hard
ground is a bed of down; the tanned skin of our bodies is an
impenetrable harness to defend us; our nimble limbs submit to no
obstacle from iron bars, or trenches, or walls; our courage is not to be
twisted out of us by cords, or choked by gauze,<a id="FNanchor_75_75"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-8.htm.html#Footnote_75_75" class="pginternal"><sup>[75]</sup></a> or quelled by the
rack.</p>
<p>"Between yes and no we make no difference when it suits our convenience
to confound them; we always pride ourselves more on being martyrs than
confessors. For us the beasts of burden are reared in the fields, and
pockets are filled in the cities. No eagle or other bird of prey pounces
more swiftly on its quarry than we upon opportunities that offer us
booty. And finally, we possess many qualities which promise us a happy
end; for we sing in prison, are silent on the rack, work by day, and by
night we thieve, or rather we take means to teach all men that they
should exempt themselves from the trouble of seeing where they put their
property. We are not distressed by the fear of losing our honour, or
kept awake by ambition to increase it. We attach ourselves to no
parties; we do not rise by day-light to attend levees and present
memorials, or to swell the trains of magnates, or to solicit favours.
Our gilded roofs and sumptuous palaces are these portable huts; our
Flemish pictures and landscapes are those which nature presents to our
eyes at every step in the rugged cliffs and snowy peaks, the spreading
meads and leafy groves. We are rustic astronomers, for as we sleep
almost always under the open sky, we can tell every hour by day or
night. We see how Aurora extinguishes and sweeps away the stars from
heaven, and how she comes forth with her companion the dawn, enlivening
the air, refreshing the water, and moistening the earth; and after her
appears the sun gilding the heights, as the poet sings, and making the
mountains smile. We are not afraid of being left chilly by his absence,
when his rays fall aslant upon us, or of being roasted when they blaze
down upon us perpendicularly. We turn the same countenance to sun and
frost, to dearth and plenty. In conclusion, we are people who live by
our industry and our wits, without troubling ourselves with the old
adage, 'The church, the sea, or the king's household.' We have all we
want, for we are content with what we have.</p>
<p>"All these things have I told you, generous youth, that you may not be
ignorant of the life to which you are come, and the manners and customs
you will have to profess, which I have here sketched for you in the
rough. Many other particulars, no less worthy of consideration, you will
discover for yourself in process of time."</p>
<p>Here the eloquent old gitano closed his discourse, and the novice
replied, that he congratulated himself much on having been made
acquainted with such laudable statutes; that he desired to make
profession of an order so based on reason and politic principles; that
his only regret was that he had not sooner come to the knowledge of so
pleasant a life; and that from that moment he renounced his knighthood,
and the vain glory of his illustrious lineage, and placed them beneath
the yoke, or beneath the laws under which they lived, forasmuch as they
so magnificently recompensed the desire he had to serve them, in
bestowing upon him the divine Preciosa, for whom he would surrender many
crowns and wide empires, or desire them only for her sake.</p>
<p>Preciosa spoke next: "Whereas these señores, our lawgivers," she said,
"have determined, according to their laws that I should be yours, and as
such have given me up to you, I have decreed, in accordance with the law
of my own will, which is the strongest of all, that I will not be so
except upon the conditions heretofore concerted between us two. You must
live two years in our company before you enjoy mine, so that you may
neither repent through fickleness, nor I be deceived through
precipitation. Conditions supersede laws; those which I have prescribed
you know; if you choose to keep them, I may be yours, and you mine; if
not, the mule is not dead, your clothes are whole, and not a doit of
your money is spent. Your absence from home has not yet extended to the
length of a day; what remains you may employ in considering what best
suits you. These señores may give up my body to you, but not my soul,
which is free, was born free, and shall remain free. If you remain, I
shall esteem you much; if you depart, I shall do so no less; for I hold
that amorous impulses run with a loose rein, until they are brought to a
halt by reason or disenchantment. I would not have you be towards me
like the sportsman, who when he has bagged a hare thinks no more of it,
but runs after another. The eyes are sometimes deceived; at first sight
tinsel looks like gold; but they soon recognise the difference between
the genuine and the false metal. This beauty of mine, which you say I
possess, and which you exalt above the sun, and declare more precious
than gold, how do I know but that at a nearer view it will appear to you
a shadow, and when tested will seem but base metal? I give you two years
to weigh and ponder well what will be right to choose or reject. Before
you buy a jewel, which you can only get rid of by death, you ought to
take much time to examine it, and ascertain its faults or its merits. I
do not assent to the barbarous licence which these kinsmen of mine have
assumed, to forsake their wives or chastise them when the humour takes
them; and as I do not intend to do anything which calls for punishment,
I will not take for my mate one who will abandon me at his own caprice."</p>
<p>"You are right, Preciosa," said Andrew; "and so if you would have me
quiet your fears and abate your doubts, by swearing not to depart a jot
from the conditions you prescribe, choose what form of oath I shall
take, or what other assurance I shall give you, and I will do exactly as
you desire."</p>
<p>"The oaths and promises which the captive makes to obtain his liberty
are seldom fulfilled when he is free," returned Preciosa; "and it is
just the same, I fancy, with the lover, who to obtain his desire will
promise the wings of Mercury, and the thunderbolts of Jove; and indeed a
certain poet promised myself no less, and swore it by the Stygian lake.
I want no oaths or promises, Señor Andrew, but to leave everything to
the result of this novitiate. It will be my business to take care of
myself, if at any time you should think of offending me."</p>
<p>"Be it so," said Andrew. "One request I have to make of these señores
and comrades mine, and that is that they will not force me to steal
anything for a month or so; for it strikes me that it will take a great
many lessons to make me a thief."</p>
<p>"Never fear, my son," said the old gipsy; "for we will instruct you in
such a manner that you will turn out an eagle in our craft; and when you
have learned it, you will like it so much, that you will be ready to eat
your hand, it will so itch after it. Yes, it is fine fun to go out
empty-handed in the morning, and to return loaded at night to the
rancho."</p>
<p>"I have seen some return with a whipping," said Andrew.</p>
<p>"One cannot catch trouts dry shod," the old man replied: "all things in
this life have their perils: the acts of the thief are liable to the
galleys, whipping, and the scragging-post; but it is not because one
ship encounters a storm, or springs a leak, that others should cease to
sail the seas. It would be a fine thing if there were to be no soldiers,
because war consumes men and horses. Besides, a whipping by the hand of
justice is for us a badge of honour, which becomes us better worn on the
shoulders than on the breast. The main point is to avoid having to dance
upon nothing in our young days and for our first offences; but as for
having our shoulders dusted, or thrashing the water in a galley, we
don't mind that a nutshell. For the present, Andrew, my son, keep snug
in the nest under the shelter of our wings; in due time, we will take
you out to fly, and that where you will not return without a prey; and
the short and the long of it is, that by and by you will lick your
fingers after every theft."</p>
<p>"Meanwhile," said Andrew, "as a compensation for what I might bring in
by thieving during the vacation allowed me, I will divide two hundred
gold crowns among all the members of the rancho."</p>
<p>The words were no sooner out of his mouth, than several gitanos caught
him up in their arms, hoisted him upon their shoulders, and bore him
along, shouting, "Long life to the great Andrew, and long life to
Preciosa his beloved!" The gitanas did the same with Preciosa, not
without exciting the envy of Christina, and the other gitanillas
present; for envy dwells alike in the tents of barbarians, the huts of
shepherds, and the palaces of princes; and to see another thrive who
seems no better than oneself is a great weariness to the spirit.</p>
<p>This done, they ate a hearty dinner, made an equitable division of the
gift money, repeated their praises of Andrew, and exalted Preciosa's
beauty to the skies. When night fell, they broke the mule's neck, and
buried it, so as to relieve Andrew of all fear of its leading to his
discovery; they likewise buried with it the trappings, saddle, bridle,
girths and all, after the manner of the Indians, whose chief ornaments
are laid in the grave with them.</p>
<p>Andrew was in no small astonishment at all he had seen and heard, and
resolved to pursue his enterprise without meddling at all with the
customs of his new companions, so far as that might be possible.
Especially he hoped to exempt himself, at the cost of his purse, from
participating with them in any acts of injustice. On the following day,
Andrew requested the gipsies to break up the camp, and remove to a
distance from Madrid; for he feared that he should be recognised if he
remained there. They told him they had already made up their minds to go
to the mountains of Toledo, and thence to scour all the surrounding
country, and lay it under contribution. Accordingly they struck their
tents, and departed, offering Andrew an ass to ride; but he chose rather
to travel on foot, and serve as attendant to Preciosa, who rode
triumphantly another ass, rejoicing in her gallant esquire; whilst he
was equally delighted at finding himself close to her whom he had made
the mistress of his freedom.</p>
<p>O potent force of him who is called the sweet god of bitterness—a title
given him by our idleness and weakness—how effectually dost thou
enslave us! Here was Andrew, a knight, a youth of excellent parts,
brought up at court, and maintained in affluence by his noble parents;
and yet since yesterday such a change has been wrought in him that he
has deceived his servants and friends; disappointed the hopes of his
parents; abandoned the road to Flanders, where he was to have exercised
his valour and increased the honours of his line; and he has prostrated
himself at the feet of a girl, made himself the lackey of one who,
though exquisitely beautiful, is after all a gitana! Wondrous
prerogative of beauty, which brings down the strongest will to its feet,
in spite of all its resistance!</p>
<p>In four days' march, the gipsies arrived at a pleasant village, within
two leagues of the great Toledo, where they pitched their camp, having
first given some articles of silver to the alcalde of the district, as a
pledge that they would steal nothing within all his bounds, nor do any
other damage that might give cause of complaint against them. This done,
all the old gitanas, some young ones, and the men, spread themselves all
over the country, to the distance of four or five leagues from the
encampment. Andrew went with them to take his first lesson in thievery;
but though they gave him many in that expedition, he did not profit by
any of them. On the contrary, as was natural in a man of gentle blood,
every theft committed by his masters wrung his very soul, and sometimes
he paid for them out of his own pocket, being moved by the tears of the
poor people who had been despoiled. The gipsies were in despair at this
behavior: it was in contravention, they said, of their statutes and
ordinances, which prohibited the admission of compassion into their
hearts; because if they had any they must cease to be thieves,—a thing
which was not to be thought of on any account. Seeing this, Andrew said
he would go thieving by himself; for he was nimble enough to run from
danger, and did not lack courage to encounter it; so that the prize or
the penalty of his thieving would be exclusively his own.</p>
<p>The gipsies tried to dissuade him from this good purpose, telling him
that occasions might occur in which he would have need of companions, as
well to attack as to defend; and that one person alone could not make
any great booty. But in spite of all they could say, Andrew was
determined to be a solitary robber; intending to separate from the gang,
and purchase for money something which he might say he had stolen, and
thus burden his conscience as little as possible. Proceeding in this
way, in less than a month, he brought more gain to the gang than four of
the most accomplished thieves in it. Preciosa rejoiced not a little to
see her tender lover become such a smart and handy thief; but for all
that she was sorely afraid of some mischance, and would not have seen
him in the hands of justice for all the treasures of Venice; such was
the good feeling towards him which she could not help entertaining, in
return for his many good offices and presents. After remaining about a
month in the Toledan district, where they reaped a good harvest, the
gipsies entered the wealthy region of Estramadura.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Andrew frequently held honourable and loving converse with
Preciosa, who was gradually becoming enamoured of his good qualities;
while, in like manner, his love for her went on increasing, if that were
possible: such were the virtues, the good sense and beauty of his
Preciosa. Whenever the gipsies engaged in athletic games, he carried off
the prize for running and leaping: he played admirably at skittles and
at ball, and pitched the bar with singular strength and dexterity. In a
short while, his fame spread through all Estramadura, and there was no
part of it where they did not speak of the smart young gitano Andrew,
and his graces and accomplishments. As his fame extended, so did that of
Preciosa's beauty; and there was no town, village, or hamlet, to which
they were not invited, to enliven their patron saints' days, or other
festivities. The tribe consequently became rich, prosperous, and
contented, and the lovers were happy in the mere sight of each other.</p>
<p>It happened one night, when the camp was pitched among some evergreen
oaks, a little off the highway, they heard their dogs barking about the
middle watch, with unusual vehemence. Andrew and some others got up to
see what was the matter, and found a man dressed in white battling with
them, whilst one of them held him by the leg. "What the devil brought
you here, man," said one of the gipsies, after they had released him,
"at such an hour, away from the high road? Did you come to thieve? If
so, you have come to the right door?"</p>
<p>"I do not come to thieve; and I don't know whether or not I am off the
road, though I see well enough that I am gone astray," said the wounded
man. "But tell me, señores, is there any venta or place of entertainment
where I can get a night's lodging, and dress the wounds which these dogs
have given me?"</p>
<p>"There is no venta or public place to which we can take you," replied
Andrew; "but as for a night's lodging, and dressing your wounds, that
you can have at our ranchos. Come along with us; for though we are
gipsies, we are not devoid of humanity."</p>
<p>"God reward you!" said the man: "take me whither you please, for my leg
pains me greatly." Andrew lifted him up, and carried him along with the
help of some of the other compassionate gipsies; for even among the
fiends there are some worse than others, and among many bad men you may
find one good.</p>
<p>It was a clear moonlight night, so that they could see that the person
they carried was a youth of handsome face and figure. He was dressed all
in white linen, with a sort of frock of the same material belted round
his waist. They arrived at Andrew's hut or shed, quickly kindled a fire,
and fetched Preciosa's grandmother to attend to the young man's hurts.
She took some of the dogs' hairs, fried them in oil, and after washing
with wine the two bites she found on the patient's left leg, she put the
hairs and the oil upon them, and over this dressing a little chewed
green rosemary. She then bound the leg up carefully with clean bandages,
made the sign of the cross over it, and said, "Now go to sleep, friend
and with the help of God your hurts will not signify."</p>
<p>Whilst they were attending to the wounded man, Preciosa stood by, eyeing
him with great curiosity, whilst he did the same by her, insomuch that
Andrew took notice of the eagerness with which he gazed; but he
attributed this to the extraordinary beauty of Preciosa, which naturally
attracted all eyes. Finally, having done all that was needful for the
youth, they left him alone on a bed of dry hay, not caring to question
him then as to his road, or any other matter.</p>
<p>As soon as all the others were gone, Preciosa called Andrew aside, and
said to him, "Do you remember, Andrew, a paper I let fall in your house,
when I was dancing with my companions, and which caused you, I think,
some uneasiness?"</p>
<p>"I remember it well," said Andrew; "it was a madrigal in your praise,
and no bad one either."</p>
<p>"Well, you must know, Andrew, that the person who wrote those verses is
no other than the wounded youth we have left in the hut. I cannot be
mistaken, for he spoke to me two or three times in Madrid, and gave me
too a very good romance. He was then dressed, I think, as a page,—not
an ordinary one, but like a favourite of some prince. I assure you,
Andrew, he is a youth of excellent understanding, and remarkably well
behaved; and I cannot imagine what can have brought him hither, and in
such a garb."</p>
<p>"What should you imagine, Preciosa, but that the same power which has
made me a gitano, has made him put on the dress of a miller, and come in
search of you? Ah, Preciosa! Preciosa! how plain it begins to be that
you pride yourself on having more than one adorer. If this be so, finish
me first, and then kill off this other, but do not sacrifice both at the
same time to your perfidy."</p>
<p>"God's mercy, Andrew, how thin-skinned you are! On how fine a thread you
make your hopes and my reputation hang, since you let the cruel sword of
jealousy so easily pierce your soul. Tell me, Andrew, if there were any
artifice or deceit in this case, could I not have held my tongue about
this youth, and concealed all knowledge of him? Am I such a fool that I
cannot help telling you what should make you doubt my integrity and good
behaviour? Hold your tongue, Andrew, in God's name, and try to-morrow to
extract from this cause of your alarm whither he is bound, and why he
is come hither. It may be that you are mistaken in your suspicion,
though I am not mistaken in what I told you of the stranger. And now for
your greater satisfaction—since it is come to that pass with me that I
seek to satisfy you—whatever be the reason of this youth's coming, send
him away at once. All our people obey you, and none of them will care to
receive him into their huts against your wish. But if this fails, I give
you my word not to quit mine, or let myself be seen by him, or by
anybody else from whom you would have me concealed. Look you, Andrew, I
am not vexed at seeing you jealous, but it would vex me much to see you
indiscreet."</p>
<p>"Unless you see me mad, Preciosa," said Andrew, "any other demonstration
would be far short of showing you what desperate havoc jealousy can make
of a man's feelings. However, I will do as you bid me, and find out what
this señor page-poet wants, whither he is going, and whom he is in
search of. It may be, that unawares he may let me get hold of some end
of thread which shall lead to the discovery of the whole snare which I
fear he is come to set for me."</p>
<p>"Jealousy, I imagine," said Preciosa, "never leaves the understanding
clear to apprehend things as they really are. Jealousy always looks
through magnifying glasses, which make mountains of molehills, and
realities of mere suspicions. On your life, Andrew, and on mine, I
charge you to proceed in this matter, and all that touches our concerns,
with prudence and discretion; and if you do, I know that you will have
to concede the palm to me, as honest, upright, and true to the very
utmost."</p>
<p>With these words she quitted Andrew, leaving him impatient for daylight,
that he might receive the confession of the wounded man, and distracted
in mind by a thousand various surmises. He could not believe but that
this page had come thither attracted by Preciosa's beauty; for the thief
believes that all men are such as himself. On the other hand, the pledge
voluntarily made to him by Preciosa appeared so highly satisfactory,
that he ought to set his mind quite at ease, and commit all his
happiness implicitly to the keeping of her good faith. At last day
appeared: he visited the wounded man; and after inquiring how he was,
and did his bites pain him, he asked what was his name, whither he was
going, and how it was he travelled so late and so far off the road. The
youth replied that he was better, and felt no pain so that he was able
to resume his journey. His name was Alonzo Hurtado; he was going to our
Lady of the Peña de Francia, on a certain business; he travelled by
night for the greater speed; and having missed his way, he had come upon
the encampment, and been worried by the dogs that guarded it. Andrew did
not by any means consider this a straightforward statement: his
suspicions returned to plague him; and, said he, "Brother, if I were a
judge, and you had been brought before me upon any charge which would
render necessary such questions as those I have put to you, the reply
you have given would oblige me to apply the thumb-screw. It is nothing
to me who you are, what is your name, or whither you are going: I only
warn you, that if it suits your convenience to lie on this journey, you
should lie with more appearance of truth. You say you are going to La
Peña de Francia, and you leave it on the right hand more than thirty
leagues behind this place. You travel by night for sake of speed, and
you quit the high road, and strike into thickets and woods where there
is scarcely a footpath. Get up, friend, learn to lie better, and go your
ways, in God's name. But in return for this good advice I give you, will
you not tell me one truth? I know you will, you are such a bad hand at
lying. Tell me, are you not one I have often seen in the capital,
something between a page and a gentleman? One who has the reputation of
being a great poet, and who wrote a romance and a sonnet upon a
gitanilla who some time ago went about Madrid, and was celebrated for
her surpassing beauty? Tell me, and I promise you, on the honour of a
gentleman gipsy, to keep secret whatever you may wish to be so kept.
Mind you, no denial that you are the person I say will go down with me;
for the face I see before me is unquestionably the same I saw in Madrid.
The fame of your talents made me often stop to gaze at you as a
distinguished man, and therefore your features are so strongly impressed
on my memory, though your dress is very different from that in which I
formerly saw you. Don't be alarmed, cheer up, and don't suppose you have
fallen in with a tribe of robbers, but with an asylum, where you may be
guarded and defended from all the world. A thought strikes me; and if
it be as I conjecture, you have been lucky in meeting me above all men.
What I conjecture is, that being in love with Preciosa—that beautiful
young gipsy, to whom you addressed the verses—you have come in search
of her; for which I don't think a bit the worse of you, but quite the
reverse: for gipsy though I am, experience has shown me how far the
potent force of love reaches, and the transformations it makes those
undergo whom it brings beneath its sway and jurisdiction. If this be so,
as I verily believe it is, the fair gitanilla is here."</p>
<p>"Yes, she is here; I saw her last night," said the stranger. This was
like a death-blow to Andrew; for it seemed at once to confirm all his
suspicions.</p>
<p>"I saw her last night," the young man repeated; "but I did not venture
to tell her who I was, for it did not suit my purpose."</p>
<p>"So, then," said Andrew, "you are indeed the poet of whom I spoke."</p>
<p>"I am: I neither can nor will deny it. Possibly it may be that where I
thought myself lost I have come right to port, if, as you say, there is
fidelity in the forests, and hospitality in the mountains."</p>
<p>"That there is, beyond doubt," said Andrew; "and among us gipsies the
strictest secrecy in the world. On that assurance, señor, you may
unburden your breast to me: you will find in mine no duplicity whatever.
The gitanilla is my relation, and entirely under my control. If you
desire her for a wife, myself and all other relations will be quite
willing; and if for a mistress, we will not make any squeamish
objections, provided you have money, for covetousness never departs from
our ranchos."</p>
<p>"I have money," the youth replied; "in the bands of this frock, which I
wear girt round my body, there are four hundred gold crowns."</p>
<p>This was another mortal blow for Andrew, who assumed that the stranger
could carry so large a sum about him for no other purpose than to
purchase possession of the beloved object. With a faltering tongue he
replied, "That is a good lump of money; you have only to discover
yourself, and go to work: the girl is no fool, and will see what a good
thing it will be for her to be yours."</p>
<p>"O friend," exclaimed the youth, "I would have you know that the power
which has made me change my garb is not that of love, as you say, nor
any longing for Preciosa; for Madrid has beauties who know how to steal
hearts and subdue souls as well as the handsomest gitanas, and better;
though I confess that the beauty of your kinswoman surpasses any I have
ever seen. The cause of my being in this dress, on foot, and bitten by
dogs, is not love but my ill luck."</p>
<p>Upon this explanation, Andrew's downcast spirit began to rise again; for
it was plain that the wind was in quite a different quarter from what he
had supposed. Eager to escape from this confusion, he renewed his
assurances of secrecy, and the stranger proceeded thus:—</p>
<p>"I was in Madrid, in the house of a nobleman, whom I served not as a
master but as a relation. He had an only son and heir, who treated me
with great familiarity and friendship, both on account of our
relationship, and because we were both of the same age and disposition.
This young gentleman fell in love with a young lady of rank, whom he
would most gladly have made his wife, had it not been for his dutiful
submission to the will of his parents, who desired him to marry into a
higher family. Nevertheless, he continued furtively to pay court to the
lady of his choice, carefully concealing his proceedings from all eyes
but mine. One night, which ill luck must have especially selected for
the adventure I am about to relate to you, as we were passing by the
lady's house, we saw ranged against it two men of good figure
apparently. My kinsman wished to reconnoitre them, but no sooner had he
made a step towards them than their swords were out, their bucklers
ready, and they made at us, whilst we did the same on our side, and
engaged them with equal arms. The fight did not last long, neither did
the lives of our two opponents; for two thrusts, urged home by my
kinsman's jealousy and my zeal in his defence, laid them both low—an
extraordinary occurrence, and such as is rarely witnessed. Thus
involuntarily victorious, we returned home, and taking all the money we
could, set off secretly to the church of San Geronimo, waiting to see
what would happen when the event was discovered next day, and what might
be the conjectures as to the persons of the homicides.</p>
<p>"We learned that no trace of our presence on the scene had been
discovered, and the prudent monks advised us to return home, so as not
by our absence to arouse any suspicion against us. We had already
resolved to follow their advice, when we were informed that the alcaldes
of the court had arrested the young lady and her parents; and that among
their domestics, whom they examined, one person, the young lady's
attendant, had stated that my kinsman visited her mistress by night and
by day. Upon this evidence they had sent in search of us; and the
officers not finding us, but many indications of our flight, it became a
confirmed opinion throughout the whole city, that we were the very men
who had slain the two cavaliers, for such they were, and of very good
quality. Finally, by the advice of the count, my relation, and of the
monks, after remaining hid a fortnight in the monastery, my comrade
departed in company with a monk, himself disguised as one, and took the
road to Aragon, intending to pass over to Italy, and thence to Flanders,
until he should see what might be the upshot of the matter. For my part,
thinking it well to divide our fortunes, I set out on foot, in a
different direction, and in the habit of a lay brother, along with a
monk, who quitted me at Talavera. From that city I travelled alone, and
missed my way, till last night I reached this wood, when I met with the
mishap you know. If I asked for La Peña de Francia, it was only by way
of making some answer to the questions put to me; for I know that it
lies beyond Salamanca."</p>
<p>"True," observed Andrew, "you left it on your right, about twenty
leagues from this. So you see what a straight road you were taking, if
you were going thither."</p>
<p>"The road I did intend to take was that to Seville; for there I should
find a Genoese gentleman, a great friend of the count my relation, who
is in the habit of exporting large quantities of silver ingots to Genoa;
and my design is, that he should send me with his carriers, as one of
themselves, by which means I may safely reach Carthagena, and thence
pass over to Italy; for two galleys are expected shortly to ship some
silver. This is my story, good friend: was I not right in saying it is
the result of pure ill luck, rather than disappointed love? Now if these
señores gitanos will take me in their company to Seville, supposing they
are bound thither, I will pay them handsomely; for I believe that I
should travel more safely with them, and have some respite from the
fear that haunts me."</p>
<p>"Yes, they will take you," said Andrew; "or if you cannot go with our
band—for as yet I know not that we are for Andalusia—you can go with
another which we shall fall in with in a couple of days; and if you give
them some of the money you have about you, they will be able and willing
to help you out of still worse difficulties." He then left the young
man, and reported to the other gipsies what the stranger desired, and
the offer he had made of good payment for their services.</p>
<p>They were all for having their guest remain in the camp; but Preciosa
was against it; and her grandmother said, that she could not go to
Seville or its neighbourhood, on account of a hoax she had once played
off upon a capmaker named Truxillo, well known in Seville. She had
persuaded him to put himself up to his neck in a butt of water, stark
naked, with a crown of cypress on his head, there to remain till
midnight, when he was to step out, and look for a great treasure, which
she had made him believe was concealed in a certain part of his house.
When the good cap-maker heard matins ring, he made such haste to get out
of the butt, lest he should lose his chance, that it fell with him,
bruising his flesh, and deluging the floor with water, in which he fell
to swimming with might and main, roaring out that he was drowning. His
wife and his neighbours ran to him with lights, and found him striking
out lustily with his legs and arms. "Help! help!" he cried; "I am
suffocating;" and he really was not far from it, such was the effect of
his excessive fright. They seized and rescued him from his deadly peril.
When he had recovered a little, he told them the trick the gipsy woman
had played him; and yet for all that, he dug a hole, more than a fathom
deep, in the place pointed out to him, in spite of all his neighbours
could say; and had he not been forcibly prevented by one of them, when
he was beginning to undermine the foundations of the house, he would
have brought the whole of it down about his ears. The story spread all
over the city; so that the little boys in the streets used to point
their fingers at him, and shout in his ears the story of the gipsy's
trick, and his own credulity. Such was the tale told by the old gitana,
in explanation of her unwillingness to go to Seville.</p>
