<p>"These things are said of good poets; but, as respects the bad ones—the
gabbling pretenders—what can we say, save only that they are the idiocy
and the arrogance of the world.</p>
<p>"Who is there that has not seen one of this sort when he is longing to
bring forth some sonnet to the ears of his neighbours? How he goes round
and round them with—'Will your worships excuse me if I read you a
little sonnet, which I made one night on a certain occasion; for it
appears to me, although indeed it be worth nothing, to have yet a
certain something—a <i>je ne scai quoi</i> of pretty, and pleasing.' Then
shall he twist his lips, and arch his eyebrows, and make a thousand
antics, diving into his pockets meanwhile and bringing out half a
hundred scraps of paper, greasy and torn, as if he had made a good
million of sonnets; he then recites that which he proffered to the
company, reading it in a chanting and affected voice.</p>
<p>"If, perchance, those who hear him, whether because of their knowledge
or their ignorance, should fail to commend him, he says, 'Either your
worships have not listened to the verses, or I have not been able to
read them properly, for indeed and in truth they deserve to be heard;'
and he begins, as before, to recite his poem, with new gestures and
varied pauses.</p>
<p>"Then to hear these poetasters censure and tear one another to pieces!
And what shall I say of the thefts committed by these cubs and whelps of
modern pretence on the grave and ancient masters of the art, or of their
malevolent carpings at those excellent persons of their own day in whom
shines the true light of poetry; who, making a solace and recreation of
their arduous labours, prove the divinity of their genius and the
elevation of their thoughts to the despite and vexation of these
ignorant pretenders, who presume to judge that of which they know
nothing, and abhor the beauties which they are not able to comprehend?
What will you have me esteem in the nullity which seeks to find place
for itself under the canopy spread for others—in the ignorance which is
ever leaning for support on another man's chair?"</p>
<p>Rodaja was once asked how it happened that poets are always poor; to
which he replied, "That if they were poor, it was because they chose to
be so, since it was always in their power to be rich if they would only
take advantage of the opportunities in their hands. For see how rich are
their ladies," he added; "have they not all a very profusion of wealth
in their possession? Is not their hair of gold, their brows of burnished
silver, their eyes of the most precious jewels, their lips of coral,
their throats of ivory and transparent crystal? Are not their tears
liquid pearls, and where they plant the soles of their feet do not
jasmine and roses spring up at the moment, however rebellious and
sterile the earth may previously have been? Then what is their breath
but pure amber, musk, and frankincense? Yet to whom do all these things
belong, if not to the poets? They are, therefore, manifest signs and
proofs of their great riches."</p>
<p>In this manner he always spoke of bad poets; as to the good ones, he was
loud in their praise, and exalted them above the horns of the moon.</p>
<p>Being at San Francisco, he one day saw some very indifferent pictures,
by an incapable hand; whereupon he remarked that the good painters
imitate nature, while the bad ones have the impertinence to daub her
face.</p>
<p>Having planted himself one day in front of a bookseller's shop with
great care, to avoid being broken, he began to talk to the owner, and
said, "This trade would please me greatly, were it not for one fault
that it has." The bookseller inquiring what that might be, Rodaja
replied, "It is the tricks you play on the writers when you purchase the
copyright of a book, and the sport you make of the author if, perchance,
he desire to print at his own cost. For what is your method of
proceeding? Instead of the one thousand five hundred copies which you
agree to print for him, you print three thousand; and when the author
supposes that you are selling his books, you are but disposing of your
own."</p>
<p>One of those men who carry sedan-chairs, once standing by while Rodaja
was enumerating the faults committed by various trades and occupations,
remarked to the latter, "Of us, Señor Doctor, you can find nothing amiss
to say." "Nothing," replied Rodaja, "except that you are made acquainted
with more sins than are known to the confessor; but with this
difference, that the confessor learns them to keep all secret, but you
to make them the public talk of the taverns."</p>
<p>A muleteer who heard this, for all kinds of people were continually
listening to him, said aloud, "There is little or nothing that you can
say of us, Señor Phial, for we are people of great worth, and very
useful servants to the commonwealth." To which the man of glass replied,
"The honour of the master exalts the honour of the servant. You,
therefore, who call those who hire your mules your masters, see whom you
serve, and what honour you may borrow from them; for your employers are
some of the dirtiest rubbish that this earth endures.</p>
<p>"Once, when I was not a man of glass, I was travelling on a mule which I
had hired, and I counted in her master one hundred and twenty-one
defects, all capital ones, and all enemies to the human kind. All
muleteers have a touch of the ruffian, a spice of the thief, and a dash
of the mountebank. If their masters, as they call those they take on
their mules, be of the butter-mouthed kind, they play more pranks with
them than all the rogues of this city could perform in a year. If they
be strangers, the muleteers rob them; if students, they malign them; if
monks, they blaspheme them; but if soldiers, they tremble before them.
These men, with the sailors, the carters, and the arrieros or pack
carriers, lead a sort of life which is truly singular, and belongs to
themselves alone.</p>
<p>"The carter passes the greater part of his days in a space not more than
a yard and a half long, for there cannot be much more between the yoke
of his mules and the mouth of his cart. He is singing for one half of
his time, and blaspheming the other; and if he have to drag one of his
wheels out of a hole in the mire, he is more aided, as it might seem,
by two great oaths than by three strong mules.</p>
<p>"The mariners are a pleasant people, but little like those of the towns,
and they can speak no other language than that used in ships. When the
weather is fine they are very diligent, but very idle, when it is
stormy. During the tempest they order much and obey little. Their ship,
which is their mess-room, is also their god, and their pastime is the
torment endured by sea-sick passengers.</p>
<p>"As to the mule-carriers, they are a race which has taken out a divorce
from all sheets, and has married the pack-saddle. So diligent and
careful are these excellent men, that to save themselves from losing a
day, they will lose their souls. Their music is the tramp of a hoof;
their sauce is hunger; their matins are an exchange of abuse and bad
words; their mass is—to hear none at all."</p>
<p>While speaking thus, Rodaja stood at an apothecary's door, and turning
to the master of the shop, he said, "Your worship's occupation would be
a most salutary one if it were not so great an enemy to your lamps."</p>
<p>"Wherein is my trade an enemy to my lamps?" asked the apothecary.</p>
<p>"In this way," replied Rodaja; "whenever other oils fail you,
immediately you take that of the lamp, as being the one which most
readily comes to hand. But there is, indeed, another fault in your
trade, and one that would suffice to ruin the most accredited physician
in the world." Being asked what that was, he replied that an apothecary
never ventured to confess, or would admit, that any drug was absent from
his stock; and so, if he have not the medicine prescribed, he makes use
of some other which, in his opinion, has the same virtues and qualities;
but as that is very seldom the case, the medicine, being badly
compounded, produces an effect contrary to that expected by the
physician.</p>
<p>Rodaja was then asked what he though, of the physicians themselves, and
he replied as follows: "<i>Honora medicum propter necessitatem, etenim
creavit cum altissimus: à Deo enim est omnis medela, et a rege accipiet
donationem: disciplina medici exaltavit caput illius, et in conspectu
magnatum collaudabitur. Altissimus de terra creavit medicinam, et vir
prudens non abhorrebit illam.</i> Thus," he added, "speaketh the Book of
Ecclesiasticus, of Medicine, and good Physicians; but of the bad ones we
may safely affirm the very contrary, since there are no people more
injurious to the commonwealth than they are. The judge may distort or
delay the justice which he should render us; the lawyer may support an
unjust demand; the merchant may help us to squander our estate, and, in
a word, all those with whom we have to deal in common life may do us
more or less injury; but to kill us without fear and standing quietly at
his ease; unsheathing no other sword than that wrapped in the folds of a
recipe, and without being subject to any danger of punishment, that can
be done only by the physician; he alone can escape all fear of the
discovery of his crimes, because at the moment of committing them he
puts them under the earth. When I was a man of flesh, and not of glass,
as I now am, I saw many things that might be adduced in support of what
I have now said, but the relation of these I refer to some other time."</p>
<p>A certain person asked him what he should do to avoid envying another,
and Rodaja bade him go to sleep, for, said he, "While you sleep you will
be the equal of him whom you envy."</p>
<p>It happened on a certain occasion that the Criminal Judge passed before
the place where Rodaja stood. There was a great crowd of people, and two
alguazils attended the magistrate, who was proceeding to his court, when
Rodaja inquired his name. Being told, he replied, "Now, I would lay a
wager that this judge has vipers in his bosom, pistols in his inkhorn,
and flashes of lightning in his hands, to destroy all that shall come
within his commission. I once had a friend who inflicted so exorbitant a
sentence in respect to a criminal commission which he held, that it
exceeded by many carats the amount of guilt incurred by the crime of the
delinquents. I inquired of him wherefore he had uttered so cruel a
sentence, and committed so manifest an injustice? To which he replied
that he intended to grant permission of appeal, and that in this way he
left the field open for the Lords of the Council to show their mercy by
moderating and reducing that too rigorous punishment to its due
proportions. But I told him it would have been still better for him to
have given such a sentence as would have rendered their labour
unnecessary, by which means he would also have merited and obtained the
reputation of being a wise and exact judge."</p>
<p>Among the number of those by whom Rodaja, as I have said, was constantly
surrounded, was an acquaintance of his own, who permitted himself to be
saluted as the Señor Doctor, although Thomas knew well that he had not
taken even the degree of bachelor. To him, therefore, he one day said,
"Take care, gossip mine, that you and your title do not meet with the
Fathers of the Redemption, for they will certainly take possession of
your doctorship as being a creature unrighteously detained captive."</p>
<p>"Let us behave well to each other, Señor Glasscase," said the other,
"since you know that I am a man of high and profound learning."</p>
<p>"I know you rather to be a Tantalus in the same," replied Rodaja; "for
if learning reach high to you, you are never able to plunge into its
depths."</p>
<p>He was one day leaning against the stall of a tailor, who was seated
with his hands before him, and to whom he said—</p>
<p>"Without doubt, Señor Maeso,<a id="FNanchor_56_56"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_56_56" class="pginternal"><sup>[56]</sup></a> you are in the way to salvation."</p>
<p>"From what symptom do you judge me to be so, Señor Doctor?" inquired the
tailor.</p>
<p>"From the fact that, as you have nothing to do, so you have nothing to
lie about, and may cease lying, which is a great step."</p>
<p>Of the shoemakers he said, that not one of that trade ever performed his
office badly; seeing that if the shoe be too narrow, and pinches the
foot, the shoemaker says, "In two hours it will be as wide as an
alpargate;" or he declares it right that it should be narrow, since the
shoe of a gentleman must needs fit closely; and if it be too wide, he
maintains that it still ought to be so, for the ease of the foot, and
lest a man should have the gout.</p>
<p>Seeing the waiting-maid of an actress attending her mistress, he said
she was much to be pitied who had to serve so many women, to say nothing
of the men whom she also had to wait on; and the bystanders requiring to
know how the damsel, who had but to serve one, could be said to wait on
so many, he replied, "Is she not the waiting-maid of a queen, a nymph,
a goddess, a scullery-maid, and a shepherdess? besides that she is also
the servant of a page and a lackey? for all these, and many more, are in
the person of an actress."</p>
<p>Some one asked Rodaja, who had been the happiest man in the world? To
which he answered—"<i>Nemo</i>, seeing that <i>Nemo novit patrem—Nemo sine
crimine vivit—Nemo sua sorte contentus—Nemo ascendit in coelum</i>," &amp;c.
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Of the fencing masters he said, that they were professors of an art
which was never to be known when it was most wanted, since they
pretended to reduce to mathematical demonstrations, which are
infallible, the angry thoughts and movements of a man's adversaries.</p>
<p>To such men as dyed their beards, Rodaja always exhibited a particular
enmity; and one day observing a Portuguese, whose beard he knew to be
dyed, in dispute with a Spaniard, to whom he said, "I swear by the beard
that I wear on my face," Rodaja called out to him, "Halt there, friend;
you should not say that you <i>wear</i> on your face, but that you dye on
your face."<a id="FNanchor_57_57"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_57_57" class="pginternal"><sup>[57]</sup></a> To another, whose beard had been streaked by an
imperfect dye, Doctor Glasscase said, "Your beard is of the true
dust-coloured pieball." He related, on another occasion, that a certain
damsel, discreetly conforming to the will of her parents, had agreed to
marry an old man with a white beard, who, on the evening before his
marriage was to take place, thought fit to have his beard dyed, and
whereas he had taken it from the sight of his betrothed as white as
snow, he presented it at the altar with a colour blacker than that of
pitch.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the damsel turned to her parents and requested them to give
her the spouse they had promised, saying that she would have him, and no
other.</p>
<p>They assured her, that he whom she there saw was the person they had
before shewn her, and given her for her spouse: but she refused to
believe it, maintaining, that he whom her parents had given her was a
grave person, with a white beard: nor was she, by any means, to be
persuaded that the dyed man before her was her betrothed, and the
marriage was broken off.</p>
<p>Towards Duennas he entertained as great a dislike as towards those who
dyed their beards—uttering wonderful things respecting their falsehood
and affectation, their tricks and pretences, their simulated scruples
and their real wickedness,—reproaching them with their fancied maladies
of stomach, and the frequent giddiness with which they were afflicted in
the head; nay, even their mode of speaking, was made the subject of his
censure; and he declared that there were more turns in their speech than
folds in their great togas and wide gowns; finally, he declared them
altogether useless, if not much worse.</p>
<p>Being one day much tormented by a hornet which settled on his neck, he
nevertheless refused to take it off, lest in seeking to catch the insect
he should break himself; but he still complained woefully of the sting.
Some one then remarked to him, that it was scarcely to be supposed he
would feel it much, since his whole person was of glass. But Rodaja
replied, that the hornet in question must needs be a slanderer, seeing
that slanderers were of a race whose tongues were capable of penetrating
bodies of bronze, to say nothing of glass.</p>
<p>A monk, who was enormously fat, one day passed near where Rodaja was
sitting, when one who stood by ironically remarked, that the father was
so reduced and consumptive, as scarcely to be capable of walking.
Offended by this, Rodaja exclaimed, "Let none forget the words of Holy
Scripture, '<i>Nolite tangere Christos meos</i>;' and, becoming still more
heated, he bade those around him reflect a little, when they would see,
that of the many saints canonised, and placed among the number of the
blessed by the Church within a few years in those parts, none had been
called the Captain Don Such a one, or the Lawyer Don So and So, or the
Count Marquis, or Duke of Such a Place; but all were brother Diego,
brother Jacinto, or brother Raimundo: all monks and friars, proceeding,
that is to say, from the monastic orders." "These," he added, "are the
orange-trees of heaven, whose fruits are placed on the table of God." Of
evil-speakers Rodaja said, that they were like the feathers of the eagle
which gnaw, wear away, and reduce to nothing, whatever feathers of
other birds are mingled with them in beds or cushions, how good soever
those feathers may be.</p>
<p>Concerning the keepers of gaming-houses he uttered wonders, and many
more than can here be repeated—commending highly the patience of a
certain gamester, who would remain all night playing and losing; yea,
though of choleric disposition by nature, he would never open his mouth
to complain, although he was suffering the martyrdom of Barabbas,
provided only his adversary did not cut the cards. At a word, Rodaja
uttered so many sage remarks, that, had it not been for the cries he
sent forth when any one approached near enough to touch him, for his
peculiar dress, slight food, strange manner of eating, and sleeping in
the air, or buried in straw, as we have related, no one could have
supposed but that he was one of the most acute persons in the world.</p>
<p>He remained more than two years in this condition; but, at the end of
that time, a monk of the order of St. Jerome, who had extraordinary
powers in the cure of lunacy, nay, who even made deaf and dumb people
hear and speak in a certain manner; this monk, I say, undertook the care
and cure of Rodaja, being moved thereto by the charity of his
disposition. Nor was it long before the lunatic was restored to his
original state of judgment and understanding. When the cure was
effected, the monk presented his patient with his previous dress of a
doctor of laws, exhorting him to return to his earlier mode of life, and
assuring him that he might now render himself as remarkable for the
force of his intellect, as he had before done for his singular folly.</p>
<p>Thomas returned accordingly to his past pursuits; but, instead of
calling himself Rodaja, as before, he assumed the name of Rueda. He had
scarcely appeared in the street, before he was recognised by the boys;
but seeing him in a dress so different from that he had before worn and
been known by, they dared not cry after him or ask him questions, but
contented themselves with saying, one to another, "Is not this the
madman, Doctor Glasscase? It is certainly he; and though he now looks so
discreet, he may be just as mad in this handsome dress as he was in that
other. Let us ask him some questions, and get rid of our doubts."</p>
<p>All this was heard by Thomas, who maintained silence, but felt much
confused, and hurried along more hastily than he had been wont to do
before he regained his senses. The men at length made the same remarks
as the boys and before he had arrived at the courts he had a train of
more than two hundred persons of all classes following him, being more
amply attended than the most popular professor of the university.</p>
<p>Having gained the first court, which is that of the entrance, these
people ended by surrounding him completely; when, perceiving that he was
so crowded on as no longer to have the power of proceeding, he finally
raised his voice, and said—</p>
<p>"Señores, it is true that I am Doctor Glass-case, but not he whom you
formerly knew. I am now Doctor Rueda. Misfortunes such as not
unfrequently happen in this world, by the permission of heaven, had
deprived me of my senses, but the mercy of God has restored them; and by
those things which you have heard me say when I was mad, you may judge
of what I shall say now that I am become sane. I am a doctor in laws of
the university of Salamanca, where I studied in much poverty, but raised
myself through all the degrees to that I now hold; but my poverty may
serve to assure you that I owe my rank to industry and not to favour. I
have come to this great sea of the Court, hoping to swim and get forward
and gain the bread of my life; but if you do not leave me I shall be
more likely to sink and find my death. For the love of God, I entreat
that you follow me no further, since, in doing so, you persecute and
injure me. What you formerly enquired of me in the streets, I beg you
now to come and ask me at my house, when you shall see that the
questions to which I before replied, impromptu, shall be more perfectly
answered now that I shall take time to consider."</p>
<p>All listened to him, many left him as he desired, and he returned to his
abode with a much smaller train. But it was every day the same: his
exhortations availed nothing; and Thomas finally resolved to repair to
Flanders, there to support himself by the strength of his arm, since he
could no longer profit by that of his intellect.</p>
<p>This resolution he executed accordingly, exclaiming as he departed—"Oh,
city and court! you by whom the expectations of the bold pretender are
fulfilled, while the hopes of the modest labourer are destroyed; you who
abundantly sustain the shameless Buffoon, while the worthy sage is left
to die of hunger; I bid you farewell." That said, he proceeded to
Flanders, where he finished in arms the life which he might have
rendered immortal by letters, and died in the company of his friend the
Captain Don Diego, leaving behind him the reputation of a most valiant
soldier and upright man.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00009"><a id="THE_DECEITFUL_MARRIAGE"/>THE DECEITFUL MARRIAGE</h2>
<p>From the Hospital of the Resurrection, which stands just beyond the
Puerta del Campo, in Valladolid, there issued one day a soldier, who, by
the excessive paleness of his countenance, and the weakness of his
limbs, which obliged him to lean upon his sword, showed clearly to all
who set eyes on him that, though the weather was not very warm, he must
have sweated a good deal in the last few weeks. He had scarcely entered
the gate of the city, with tottering steps, when he was accosted by an
old friend who had not seen him for the last six months, and who
approached the invalid, making signs of the cross as if he had seen a
ghost. "What; is all this?" he cried; "do I, indeed, behold the Señor
Alferez<a id="FNanchor_58_58"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-6.htm.html#Footnote_58_58" class="pginternal"><sup>[58]</sup></a> Campuzano? Is it possible that I really see you in this
country? Why, I thought you were in Flanders trailing a pike, instead of
hobbling along with your sword for a walking-stick. How pale—how
emaciated you look!"</p>
<p>"As to whether I am in this country or elsewhere, Sigñor Licentiate
Peralta, the fact that you now see me is a sufficient answer," replied
Campuzano; "as for your other questions, all I can tell you is, that I
have just come out of that hospital, where I have been confined for a
long time in a dreadful state of health, brought upon me by the conduct
of a woman I was indiscreet enough to make my wife."</p>
<p>"You have been married, then?" said Peralta.</p>
<p>"Yes, Señor."</p>
<p>"Married without benefit of clergy, I presume. Marriages of that sort
bring their own penance with them."</p>
<p>"Whether it was without benefit of clergy I cannot say," replied the
Alferez; "but I can safely aver that it was not without benefit of
physic. Such were the torments of body and soul which my marriage
brought upon me, that those of the body cost me forty sudations to cure
them, and, as for those of the soul, there is no remedy at all that can
relieve them. But excuse me, if I cannot hold a long conversation in the
street; another day I will, with more convenience, relate to you my
adventures, which are the strangest and most singular you ever heard in
all the days of your life."</p>
<p>"That will not do," said the licentiate; "I must have you come to my
lodgings, and there we will do penance together.<a id="FNanchor_59_59"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-6.htm.html#Footnote_59_59" class="pginternal"><sup>[59]</sup></a> You will have an
olla, very fit for a sick man; and though it is scantly enough for two,
we will make up the deficiency with a pie and a few slices of Rute ham,
and, above all, with a hearty welcome, not only now, but whenever you
choose to claim it."</p>
<p>Campuzano accepted the polite invitation. They turned into the church of
San Lorente and heard mass, and then Peralta took his friend home,
treated him as he had promised, repeated his courteous offers, and
requested him after dinner to relate his adventures. Campuzano, without
more ado, began as follows:—</p>
<p>You remember, Señor Licentiate Peralta, how intimate I was in this city
with Captain Pedro de Herrera, who is now in Flanders. "I remember it
very well," replied Peralta. Well, one day when we had done dinner in
the Posada della Solana, where we lived, there came in two ladies of
genteel appearance, with two waiting women: one of the ladies entered
into conversation with the Captain, both leaning against a window; the
other sat down in a chair beside me, with her veil low down, so that I
could not see her face, except so far as the thinness of the texture
allowed. I entreated her to do me the favour to unveil, but I could not
prevail, which the more inflamed my desire to have sight of her; but
what especially increased my curiosity was that, whether on purpose, or
by chance, the lady displayed a very white hand, with very handsome
rings.</p>
<p>At that time I made a very gallant appearance with that great chain you
have seen me wear, my hat with plumes and bands, my flame-coloured
military garments, and, in the eyes of my own folly, I seemed so
engaging that I imagined all the women must fall in love with me! Well,
I implored her to unveil. "Be not importunate," she replied; "I have a
house; let a servant follow me; for though I am of more honourable
condition than this reply of mine would indicate, yet for the sake of
seeing whether your discretion corresponds to your gallant appearance, I
will allow you to see me with less reserve." I kissed her hand for the
favour she granted me, in return for which I promised mountains of gold.
The captain ended his conversation, the ladies went away, and a servant
of mine followed them. The captain told me that what the lady had been
asking of him was to take some letters to Flanders to another captain,
who she said was her cousin, though he knew he was nothing but her
gallant.</p>
<p>For my part I was all on fire for the snow-white hands I had seen, and
dying for a peep at the face; so I presented myself next day at the door
which my servant pointed out to me, and was freely admitted. I found
myself in a house very handsomely decorated and furnished, in presence
of a lady about thirty years of age, whom I recognised by her hands. Her
beauty was not extraordinary, but of a nature well suited to fascinate
in conversation; for she talked with a sweetness of tone that won its
way through the ears to the soul. I had long <i>tête-à-têtes</i> with her, in
which I made love with all my might: I bragged, bounced, swaggered,
offered, promised, and made all the demonstrations I thought necessary
to work myself into her good graces; but as she was accustomed to such
offers and protestations, she listened to them with an attentive, but
apparently far from credulous ear. In short, during the four days I
continued to visit her, our intercourse amounted only to talking soft
nonsense, without my being able to gather the tempting fruit.</p>
<p>In the course of my visits I always found the house free from intruders,
and without a vestige of pretended relations or real gallants. She was
waited on by a girl in whom there was more of the rogue than the
simpleton. At last resolving to push my suit in the style of a soldier,
who is about to shift his quarters, I came to the point with my fair
one, Doña Estefania de Caycedo (for that is the name of my charmer), and
this was the answer she gave me:—"Señor Alferez Campuzano, I should be
a simpleton if I sought to pass myself off on you for a saint; I have
been a sinner, ay, and am one still, but not in a manner to become a
subject of scandal in the neighbourhood or of notoriety in public. I
have inherited no fortune either from my parents or any other relation;
and yet the furniture of my house is worth a good two thousand five
hundred ducats, and would fetch that sum it put up to auction at any
moment. With this property I look for a husband to whom I may devote
myself in all obedience, and with whom I may lead a better life, whilst
I apply myself with incredible solicitude to the task of delighting and
serving him; for there is no master cook who can boast of a more refined
palate, or can turn out more exquisite ragouts and made-dishes than I
can, when I choose to display my housewifery in that way. I can be the
major domo in the house, the tidy wench in the kitchen, and the lady in
the drawing room: in fact, I know how to command and make myself obeyed.
I squander nothing and accumulate a great deal; my coin goes all the
further for being spent under my own directions. My household linen, of
which I have a large and excellent stock, did not come out of drapers'
shops or warehouses; these fingers and those of my maid servants
stitched it all, and it would have been woven at home had that been
possible. If I give myself these commendations, it is because I cannot
incur your censure by uttering what it is absolutely necessary that you
should know. In fine, I wish to say that I desire a husband to protect,
command, and honour me, and not a gallant to flatter and abuse me: if
you like to accept the gift that is offered you, here I am, ready and
willing to put myself wholly at your disposal, without going into the
public market with my hand, for it amounts to no less to place oneself
at the mercy of match-makers' tongues, and no one is so fit to arrange
the whole affair as the parties themselves."</p>
<p>My wits were not in my head at that moment, but in my heels. Delighted
beyond imagination, and seeing before me such a quantity of property,
which I already beheld by anticipation converted into ready money,
without making any other reflections than those suggested by the longing
that fettered my reason, I told her that I was fortunate and blest above
all men since heaven had given me by a sort of miracle such a companion,
that I might make her the lady of my affections and my fortune,—a
fortune which was not so small, but that with that chain which I wore
round my neck, and other jewels which I had at home, and by disposing
of some military finery, I could muster more than two thousand ducats,
which, with her two thousand five hundred, would be enough for us to
retire upon to a village of which I was a native, and where I had
relations and some patrimony. Its yearly increase, helped by our money,
would enable us to lead a cheerful and unembarrassed life. In fine, our
union was at once agreed on; the banns were published on three
successive holidays (which happened to fall together), and on the fourth
day, the marriage was celebrated in the presence of two friends of mine,
and a youth who she said was her cousin, and to whom I introduced myself
as a relation with words of great urbanity. Such, indeed, were all those
which hitherto I had bestowed on my bride—with how crooked and
treacherous an intention I would rather not say; for though I am telling
truths, they are not truths under confession which must not be kept
back.</p>
<p>My servant removed my trunk from my lodgings to my wife's house. I put
by my magnificent chain in my wife's presence; showed her three or four
others, not so large, but of better workmanship, with three or four
other trinkets of various kinds; laid before her my best dresses and my
plumes, and gave her about four hundred reals, which I had, to defray
the household expenses. For six days I tasted the bread of wedlock,
enjoying myself like a beggarly bridegroom in the house of a rich
father-in-law. I trod on rich carpets, lay in holland sheets, had silver
candlesticks to light me, breakfasted in bed, rose at eleven o'clock,
dined at twelve, and at two took my siesta in the drawing-room. Doña
Estefania and the servant girl danced attendance upon me; my servant,
whom I had always found lazy, was suddenly become nimble as a deer. If
ever Doña Estefania quitted my side, it was to go to the kitchen and
devote all her care to preparing fricassees to please my palate and
quicken my appetite. My shirts, collars, and handkerchiefs were a very
Aranjuez of flowers, so drenched they were with fragrant waters. Those
days flew fast, like the years which are under the jurisdiction of time;
and seeing myself so regaled and so well treated, I began to change for
the better the evil intention with which I had begun this affair.</p>
<p>At the end of them, one morning, whilst I was still in bed with Doña
Estefania, there was a loud knocking and calling at the street door. The
servant girl put her head out of the window, and immediately popped it
in again, saying,—"There she is, sure enough; she is come sooner than
she mentioned in her letter the other day, but she is welcome!"</p>
<p>"Who's come, girl?" said I.</p>
<p>"Who?" she replied; "why, my lady Doña Clementa Bueso, and with her
señor Don Lope Melendez de Almendarez, with two other servants, and
Hortigosa, the dueña she took with her."</p>
<p>"Bless me! Run, wench, and open the door for them," Doña Estefania now
exclaimed; "and you, señor, as you love me, don't put yourself out, or
reply for me to anything you may hear said against me."</p>
<p>"Why, who is to say anything to offend you, especially when I am by?
Tell me, who are these people, whose arrival appears to have upset you?"</p>
<p>"I have no time to answer," said Doña Estefania; "only be assured that
whatever takes place here will be all pretended, and bears upon a
certain design which you shall know by and by."</p>
<p>Before I could make any reply to this, in walked Doña Clementa Bueso,
dressed in lustrous green satin, richly laced with gold, a hat with
green, white, and pink feathers, a gold hat-band, and a fine veil
covering half her face. With her entered Don Lope Melendez de Almendarez
in a travelling suit, no less elegant than rich. The dueña Hortigosa was
the first who opened her lips, exclaiming, "Saints and angels, what is
this! My lady Doña Clementa's bed occupied, and by a man too! Upon my
faith, the señora Doña Estefania has availed herself of my lady's
friendliness to some purpose!"</p>
<p>"That she has, Hortigosa," replied Doña Clementa; "but I blame myself
for never being on my guard against friends who can only be such when it
is for their own advantage."</p>
<p>To all this Doña Estefania replied: "Pray do not be angry, my lady Doña
Clementa. I assure you there is a mystery in what you see; and when you
are made acquainted with it you will acquit me of all blame."</p>
<p>During this time I had put on my hose and doublet, and Doña Estefania,
taking me by the hand, led me into another room. There she told me that
this friend of hers wanted to play a trick on that Don Lope who was
come with her, and to whom she expected to be married. The trick was to
make him believe that the house and everything in it belonged to
herself. Once married, it would matter little that the truth was
discovered, so confident was the lady in the great love of Don Lope; the
property would then be returned; and who could blame her, or any woman,
for contriving to get an honourable husband, though it were by a little
artifice? I replied that it was a very great stretch of friendship she
thought of making, and that she ought to look well to it beforehand, for
very probably she might be constrained to have recourse to justice to
recover her effects. She gave me, however, so many reasons, and alleged
so many obligations by which she was bound to serve Doña Clementa even
in matters of more importance, that much against my will, and with sore
misgivings, I complied with Doña Estefania's wishes, on the assurance
that the affair would not last more than eight days, during which we
were to lodge with another friend of hers.</p>
<p>We finished dressing; she went to take her leave of the señora Doña
Clementa Bueso and the señor Lope Melendez Almendarez, ordered my
servant to follow her with my luggage, and I too followed without taking
leave of any one. Doña Estefania stopped at a friend's house, and stayed
talking with her a good while, leaving us in the street, till at last a
girl came out and told me and my servant to come in. We went up stairs
to a small room in which there were two beds so close together that they
seemed but one, for the bed-clothes actually touched each other. There
we remained six days, during which not an hour passed in which we did
not quarrel; for I was always telling her what a stupid thing she had
done in giving up her house and goods, though it were to her own mother.
One day, when Doña Estefania had gone out, as she said, to see how her
business was going on, the woman of the house asked me what was the
reason of my wrangling so much with my wife, and what had she done for
which I scolded her so much, saying it was an act of egregious folly
rather than of perfect friendship. I told her the whole story, how I had
married Doña Estefania, the dower she had brought me, and the folly she
had committed in leaving her house and goods to Doña Clementa, even
though it was for the good purpose of catching such a capital husband as
Don Lope. Thereupon the woman began to cross and bless herself at such
a rate, and to cry out, "O, Lord! O, the jade!" that she put me into a
great state of uneasiness. At last, "Señor Alferez," said she, "I don't
know but I am going against my conscience in making known to you what I
feel would lie heavy on it if I held my tongue. Here goes, however, in
the name of God,—happen what may, the truth for ever, and lies to the
devil! The truth is, that Doña Clementa Bueso is the real owner of the
house and property which you have had palmed upon you for a dower; the
lies are every word that Doña Estefania has told you, for she has
neither house nor goods, nor any clothes besides those on her back. What
gave her an opportunity for this trick was that Doña Clementa went to
visit one of her relations in the city of Plasencia, and there to
perform a novenary in the church of our Lady of Guadalupe, meanwhile
leaving Doña Estefania to look after her house, for in fact they are
great friends. And after all, rightly considered, the poor señora is not
to blame, since she has had the wit to get herself such a person as the
Señor Alferez for a husband."</p>
<p>Here she came to an end, leaving me almost desperate; and without doubt
I should have become wholly so, if my guardian angel had failed in the
least to support me, and whisper to my heart that I ought to consider I
was a Christian, and that the greatest sin men can be guilty of is
despair, since it is the sin of devils. This consideration, or good
inspiration, comforted me a little; not so much, however, but that I
took my cloak and sword, and went out in search of Doña Estefania,
resolved to inflict upon her an exemplary chastisement; but chance
ordained, whether for my good or not I cannot tell, that she was not to
be found in any of the places where I expected to fall in with her. I
went to the church of San Lorente, commended me to our Lady, sat down on
a bench, and in my affliction fell into so deep a sleep that I should
not have awoke for a long time if others had not roused me. I went with
a heavy heart to Doña Clementa's, and found her as much at ease as a
lady should be in her own house. Not daring to say a word to her,
because Señor Don Lope was present, I returned to my landlady, who told
me she had informed Doña Estefania that I was acquainted with her whole
roguery; that she had asked how I had seemed to take the news; that
she, the landlady, said I had taken it very badly, and had gone out to
look for her, apparently with the worst intentions; whereupon Doña
Estefania had gone away, taking with her all that was in my trunk, only
leaving me one travelling coat. I flew to my trunk, and found it open,
like a coffin waiting for a dead body; and well might it have been my
own, if sense enough had been left me to comprehend the magnitude of my
misfortune.</p>
<p>"Great it was, indeed," observed the licentiate Peralta; "only to think
that Doña Estefania carried off your fine chain and hat-band! Well, it
is a true saying, 'Misfortunes never come single.'"</p>
<p>I do not so much mind that loss, replied the Alferez, since I may apply
to myself the old saw, "My father-in-law thought to cheat me by putting
off his squinting daughter upon me; and I myself am blind of an eye."</p>
<p>"I don't know in what respect you can say that?" replied Peralta.</p>
<p>Why, in this respect, that all that lot of chains and gewgaws might be
worth some ten or twelve crowns.</p>
<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed the licentiate; "for that which the Señor
Alferez wore on his neck must have weighed more than two hundred
ducats."</p>
<p>So it would have done, replied the Alferez, if the reality had
corresponded with the appearance; but "All is not gold that glitters,"
and my fine things were only imitations, but so well made that nothing
but the touchstone or the fire could have detected that they were not
genuine.</p>
<p>"So, then, it seems to have been a drawn game between you and the Señora
Doña Estefania," said the licentiate.</p>
<p>So much so that we may shuffle the cards and make a fresh deal. Only the
mischief is, Señor Licentiate, that she may get rid of my mock chains,
but I cannot get rid of the cheat she put upon me; for, in spite of my
teeth, she remains my wife.</p>
<p>"You may thank God, Señor Campuzano," said Peralta, "that your wife has
taken to her heels, and that you are not obliged to go in search of
her."</p>
<p>Very true; but for all that, even without looking for her, I always find
her—in imagination; and wherever I am, my disgrace is always present
before me.</p>
<p>"I know not what answer to make you, except to remind you of these two
verses of Petrarch:—</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"'Che qui prende diletto di far frode,<br/>
</span>
<span>Non s'ha di lamentar s'altro l'inganna.'<br/>
</span>
</div></div>
<p>That is to say, whoever makes it his practice and his pleasure to
deceive others, has no right to complain when he is himself deceived."</p>
<p>But I don't complain, replied the Alferez; only I pity myself—for the
culprit who knows his fault does not the less feel the pain of his
punishment. I am well aware that I sought to deceive and that I was
deceived, and caught in my own snare; but I cannot command my feelings
so much as not to lament over myself. To come, however, to what more
concerns my history (for I may give that name to the narrative of my
adventures), I learned that Doña Estefania had been taken away by that
cousin whom she brought to our wedding, who had been a lover of hers of
long standing. I had no mind to go after her and bring back upon myself
an evil I was rid of. I changed my lodgings and my skin too within a few
days. My eyebrows and eyelashes began to drop; my hair left me by
degrees; and I was bald before my time, and stripped of everything; for
I had neither a beard to comb nor money to spend. My illness kept pace
with my want; and as poverty bears down honour, drives some to the
gallows, some to the hospital, and makes others enter their enemies'
doors with cringing submissiveness, which is one of the greatest
miseries that can befall an unlucky man; that I might not expend upon my
cure the clothes that should cover me respectably in health, I entered
the Hospital of the Resurrection, where I took forty sudations. They say
that I shall get well if I take care of myself. I have my sword; for the
rest I trust in God.</p>
<p>The licentiate renewed his friendly offers, much wondering at the things
he had heard.</p>
<p>If you are surprised at the little I have told you, Señor Peralta, said
the Alferez, what will you say to the other things I have yet to relate,
which exceed all imagination, since they pass all natural bounds? I can
only tell you that they are such that I think it a full compensation for
all my disasters that they were the cause of my entering the hospital,
where I saw what I shall now relate to you; and what you can never
believe; no; nor anybody else in the world.</p>
<p>All these preambles of the Alferez so excited Peralta's curiosity, that
he earnestly desired to hear, in detail, all that remained to be told.</p>
<p>You have no doubt seen, said the Alferez, two dogs going about by night
with lanterns along with the Capuchin brethren, to give them light when
they are collecting alms.</p>
<p>"I have," replied Peralta.</p>
<p>You have also seen, or heard tell of them, that if alms are thrown from
the windows, and happen to fall on the ground, they immediately help
with the light and begin to look for what has fallen; that they stop of
their own accord before the windows from which they know they are used
to receive alms; and that with all their tameness on these occasions, so
that they are more like lambs than dogs, they are lions in the hospital,
keeping guard with great care and vigilance.</p>
<p>"I have heard that all this is as you say," said Peralta; "but there is
nothing in this to move my wonder."</p>
<p>But what I shall now tell you of them, returned the Alferez, is enough
to do so; yet, strange as it is, you must bring yourself to believe it.
One night, the last but one of my sudation, I heard, and all but saw
with my eyes those two dogs, one of which is called Scipio, the other
Berganza, stretched on an old mat outside my room. In the middle of the
night, lying awake in the dark, thinking of my past adventures and my
present sorrows, I heard talking, and set myself to listen attentively,
to see if I could make out who were the speakers and what they said. By
degrees I did both, and ascertained that the speakers were the dogs
Scipio and Berganza.</p>
<p>The words were hardly out of Campuzano's mouth, when the licentiate
jumped up and said: "Saving your favour, Señor Campuzano, till this
moment I was in much doubt whether or not to believe what you have told
me about your marriage; but what you now tell me of your having heard
dogs talk, makes me decide upon not believing you at all. For God's
sake, Señor Alferez, do not relate such nonsense to any body, unless it
be to one who is as much your friend as I am."</p>
<p>Do not suppose I am so ignorant, replied Campuzano, as not to know that
brutes cannot talk unless by a miracle. I well know that if starlings,
jays, and parrots talk, it is only such words as they have learned by
rote, and because they have tongues adapted to pronounce them; but they
cannot, for all that, speak and reply with deliberate discourse as those
dogs did. Many times, indeed, since I heard them I have been disposed
not to believe myself, but to regard as a dream that which, being really
awake, with all the five senses which our Lord was pleased to give me, I
heard, marked, and finally wrote down without missing a word; whence you
may derive proof enough to move and persuade you to believe this verity
which I relate. The matters they talked of were various and weighty,
such as might rather have been discussed by learned men than by the
mouths of dogs; so that, since I could not have invented them out of my
own head, I am come, in spite of myself, to believe that I did not
dream, and that the dogs did talk.</p>
<p>"Body of me!" exclaimed the licentiate, "are the times of Æsop come back
to us, when the cock conversed with the fox, and one beast with
another?"</p>
<p>I should be one of them, and the greatest, replied the Alferez, if I
believed that time had returned; and so I should be, too, if I did not
believe what I have heard and seen, and what I am ready to swear to by
any form of oath that can constrain incredulity itself to believe. But,
supposing that I have deceived myself, and that this reality was a
dream, and that to contend for it is an absurdity, will it not amuse
you, Señor Peralta, to see, written in the form of a dialogue, the
matters talked of by those dogs, or whoever the speakers may have been?</p>
<p>"Since you no longer insist on having me believe that you heard dogs
talk," replied Peralta, "with much pleasure I will hear this colloquy,
of which I augur well, since it is reported by a gentlemen of such
talents as the Señor Alferez."</p>
<p>Another thing I have to remark, said Campuzano, is, that, as I was very
attentive, my apprehension very sensitive, and my memory very retentive
(thanks to the many raisins and almonds I had swallowed), I got it all
by heart, and wrote it down, word for word, the next day, without
attempting to colour or adorn it, or adding or suppressing anything to
make it attractive. The conversation took place not on one night only,
but on two consecutive nights, though I have not written down more than
one dialogue, that which contains the life of Berganza. His comrade
Scipio's life, which was the subject of the second night's discourse, I
intend to write out, if I find that the first one is believed, or at
least not despised. I have thrown the matter into the form of a dialogue
to avoid the cumbrous repetition of such phrases as, <i>said Scipio</i>,
<i>replied Berganza</i>.</p>
<p>So saying, he took a roll of paper out of his breast pocket, and put it
in the hands of the licentiate, who received it with a smile, as if he
made very light of all he had heard, and was about to read.</p>
<p>I will recline on this sofa, said the Alferez, whilst you are reading
those dreams or ravings, if you will, which have only this to recommend
them, that you may lay them down when you grow tired of them.</p>
<p>"Make yourself comfortable," said Peralta; "and I will soon despatch my
reading."</p>
<p>The Alferez lay down; the licentiate opened the scroll, and found it
headed as follows:—</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00010"><a id="DIALOGUE"/>DIALOGUE BETWEEN SCIPIO AND BERGANZA,</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00011">DOGS OF THE HOSPITAL OF THE RESURRECTION IN THE CITY OF VALLADOLID,
COMMONLY CALLED THE DOGS OF MAHUDES.</h3>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Berganza, my friend, let us leave our watch over the hospital
to-night, and retire to this lonely place and these mats, where, without
being noticed, we may enjoy that unexampled favour which heaven has
bestowed on us both at the same moment.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Brother Scipio, I hear you speak, and know that I am speaking to
you; yet cannot I believe, so much does it seem to me to pass the bounds
of nature.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> That is true, Berganza; and what makes the miracle greater is,
that we not only speak but hold intelligent discourse, as though we had
souls capable of reason; whereas we are so far from having it, that the
difference between brutes and man consists in this, that man is a
rational animal and the brute is irrational.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I hear all you say, Scipio; and that you say it, and that I
hear it, causes me fresh admiration and wonder. It is very true that in
the course of my life I have many a time heard tell of our great
endowments, insomuch that some, it appears, have been disposed to think
that we possess a natural instinct, so vivid and acute in many things
that it gives signs and tokens little short of demonstrating that we
have a certain sort of understanding capable of reason.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> What I have heard highly extolled is our strong memory, our
gratitude, and great fidelity; so that it is usual to depict us as
symbols of friendship. Thus you will have seen (if it has ever come
under your notice) that, on the alabaster tombs, on which are
represented the figures of those interred in them, when they are husband
and wife, a figure of a dog is placed between the pair at their feet, in
token that in life their affection and fidelity to each other was
inviolable,</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I know that there have been grateful dogs who have cast
themselves into the same grave with the bodies of their deceased
masters; others have stood over the graves in which their lords were
buried without quitting them or taking food till they died. I know,
likewise, that next to the elephant the dog holds the first place in the
way of appearing to possess understanding, then the horse, and last the
ape.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> True; but you will surely confess that you never saw or heard
tell of any elephant, dog, horse, or monkey having talked: hence I
infer, that this fact of our coming by the gift of speech so
unexpectedly falls within the list of those things which are called
portents, the appearance of which indicates, as experience testifies,
that some great calamity threatens the nations.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> That being so I can readily enough set down as a portentous
token what I heard a student say the other day as I passed through
Alcala de Henares.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> What was that?</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> That of five thousand students this year attending the
university—two thousand are studying medicine.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> And what do you infer from that?</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I infer either that those two thousand doctors will have
patients to treat, and that would be a woful thing, or that they must
die of hunger.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Be that as it may, let us talk, portent or no portent; for what
heaven has ordained to happen, no human diligence or wit can prevent.
Nor is it needful that we should fall to disputing as to the how or the
why we talk. Better will it be to make the best of this good clay or
good night at home; and since we enjoy it so much on these mats, and
know not how long this good fortune of ours may last, let us take
advantage of it and talk all night, without suffering sleep to deprive
us of a pleasure which I, for my part, have so long desired.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> And I, too; for ever since I had strength enough to gnaw a bone
I have longed for the power of speech, that I might utter a multitude of
things I had laid up in my memory, and which lay there so long that they
were growing musty or almost forgotten. Now, however, that I see myself
so unexpectedly enriched with this divine gift of speech, I intend to
enjoy it and avail myself of it as much as I can, taking pains to say
everything I can recollect, though it be confusedly and helter-skelter,
not knowing when this blessing, which I regard as a loan, shall be
reclaimed from me.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Let us proceed in this manner, friend Berganza: to-night you
shall relate the history of your life to me, and the perils through
which you have passed to the present hour; and to-morrow night, if we
still have speech, I will recount mine to you; for it will be better to
spend the time in narrating our own lives than in trying to know those
of others.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I have ever looked upon you, Scipio, as a discreet dog and a
friend, and now I do so more than ever, since, as a friend, you desire
to tell me your adventures and know mine; and, as a discreet dog, you
apportion the time in which we may narrate them. But first observe
whether any one overhears us.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> No one, I believe; since hereabouts there is a soldier going
through a sweating-course; but at this time of night he will be more
disposed to sleep than to listen to anything.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Since then we can speak so securely, hearken; and if I tire you
with what I say, either check me or bid me hold my tongue.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Talk till dawn, or till we are heard, and I will listen to you
with very great pleasure, without interrupting you, unless I see it to
be necessary.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> It appears to me that the first time I saw the sun was in
Seville, in its slaughter-houses, which were outside the Puerta do la
Carne; wence I should imagine (were it not for what I shall afterwards
tell you) that my progenitors were some of those mastiff's which are
bred by those ministers of confusion who are called butchers. The first
I knew for a master, was one Nicholas the Pugnosed, a stout, thick-set,
passionate fellow, as all butchers are. This Nicholas taught me and
other whelps to run at bulls in company with old dogs and catch them by
the ears. With great ease I became an eagle among my fellows in this
respect.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> I do not wonder, Berganza, that ill-doing is so easily learned,
since it comes by a natural obliquity.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> What can I say to you, brother Scipio, of what I saw in those
slaughter-houses, and the enormous things that were done in them? In the
first place, you must understand that all who work in them, from the
lowest to the highest, are people without conscience or humanity,
fearing neither the king nor his justice; most of them living in
concubinage; carrion birds of prey; maintaining themselves and their
doxies by what they steal. On all flesh days, a great number of wenches
and young chaps assemble in the slaughtering place before dawn, all of
them with bags which come empty and go away full of pieces of meat. Not
a beast is killed out of which these people do not take tithes, and that
of the choicest and most savoury pickings. The masters trust implicitly
in these honest folk, not with the hope that they will not rob them (for
that is impossible), but that they may use their knives with some
moderation. But what struck me as the worst thing of all, was that these
butchers make no more of killing a man than a cow. They will quarrel for
straws, and stick a knife into a person's body as readily as they would
fell an ox. It is a rare thing for a day to pass without brawls and
bloodshed, and even murder. They all pique themselves on being men of
mettle, and they observe, too, some punctilios of the bravo; there is
not one of them but has his guardian angel in the Plaza de San
Francesco, whom he propitiates with sirloins, and beef tongues.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> If you mean to dwell at such length, friend Berganza, on the
characteristics and faults of all the masters you have had, we had
better pray to heaven to grant us the gift of speech for a year; and
even then I fear, at the rate you are going, you will not get through
half your story. One thing I beg to remark to you, of which you will see
proof when I relate my own adventures; and that is, that some stories
are pleasing in themselves, and others from the manner in which they are
told; I mean that there are some which give satisfaction, though they
are told without preambles and verbal adornments; while others require
to be decked in that way and set off by expressive play of features,
hands, and voice; whereby, instead of flat and insipid, they become
pointed and agreeable. Do not forget this hint, but profit by it in what
you are about to say.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I will do so, if I can, and if I am not hindered by the great
temptation I feel to speak; though, indeed, it appears to me that I
shall have the greatest difficulty in constraining myself to moderation.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Be wary with your tongue, for from that member flow the greatest
ills of human life.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Well, then, to go on with my story, my master taught me to carry
a basket in my mouth, and to defend it against any one who should
attempt to take it from me. He also made me acquainted with the house in
which his mistress lived, and thereby spared her servant the trouble of
coming to the slaughter-house, for I used to carry to her the pieces of
meat he had stolen over night. Once as I was going along on this errand
in the gray of the morning, I heard some one calling me by name from a
window. Looking up I saw an extremely pretty girl; she came down to the
street door, and began to call me again. I went up to her to see what
she wanted of me; and what was it but to take away the meat I was
carrying in the basket and put an old clog in its place? "Be off with
you," she said, when she had done so; "and tell Nicholas the Pugnosed,
your master, not to put trust in brutes." I might easily have made her
give up what she had taken from me; but I would not put a cruel tooth on
those delicate white hands.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> You did quite right; for it is the prerogative of beauty always
to be held in respect.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> Well, I went back to my master without the meat and with the old
clog. It struck him that I had come back very soon, and seeing the clog,
he guessed the trick, snatched up a knife, and flung it at me; and if I
had not leaped aside, you would not now be listening to my story. I
took to my heels, and was off like a shot behind St. Bernard's, away
over the fields, without stopping to think whither my luck would lead
me. That night I slept under the open sky, and the following day I
chanced to fall in with a flock of sheep. The moment I saw it, I felt
that I had found the very thing that suited me, since it appeared to me
to be the natural and proper duty of dogs to guard the fold, that being
an office which involves the great virtue of protecting and defending
the lowly and the weak against the proud and mighty. One of the three
shepherds who were with the flock immediately called me to him, and I,
who desired nothing better, went up at once to him, lowering my head and
wagging my tail. He passed his hand along my back, opened my mouth,
examined my fangs, ascertained my age, and told his master that I had
all the works and tokens of a dog of good breed. Just then up came the
owner of the flock on a gray mare with lance and surge, so that he
looked more a coast-guard than a sheep master.</p>
<p>"What dog is that!" said he to the shepherd; "he seems a good one." "You
may well say that," replied the man; "for I have examined him closely,
and there is not a mark about him but shows that he must be of the right
sort. He came here just now; I don't know whose he is, but I know that
he does not belong to any of the flocks hereabouts."</p>
<p>"If that be so," said the master, "put on him the collar that belonged
to the dog that is dead, and give him the same rations as the rest,
treat him kindly that he may take a liking to the fold, and remain with
it henceforth." So saying he went away, and the shepherd put on my neck
a collar set with steel points, after first giving me a great mess of
bread sopped in milk in a trough. At the same time I had a name bestowed
on me, which was Barcino. I liked my second master, and my new duty very
well; I was careful and diligent in watching the flock, and never
quitted it except in the afternoons, when I went to repose under the
shade of some tree, or rock, or bank, or by the margin of one of the
many streams that watered the country. Nor did I spend those leisure
hours idly, but employed them in calling many things to mind, especially
the life I had led in the slaughter-house, and also that of my master
and all his fellows, who were bound to satisfy the inordinate humours
of their mistresses. O how many things I could tell you of that I
learned in the school of that she-butcher, my master's lady; but I must
pass them over, lest you should think me tedious and censorious.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> I have heard that it was a saying of a great poet among the
ancients, that it was a difficult thing to write satires. I consent that
you put some point into your remarks, but not to the drawing of blood.
You may hit lightly, but not wound or kill; for sarcasm, though it make
many laugh, is not good if it mortally wounds one; and if you can please
without it, I shall think you more discreet.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I will take your advice, and I earnestly long for the time when
you will relate your own adventures; for seeing how judiciously you
correct the faults into which I fall in my narrative, I may well expect
that your own will be delivered in a manner equally instructive and
delightful. But to take up the broken thread of my story, I say that in
those hours of silence and solitude, it occurred to me among other
things, that there could be no truth in what I had heard tell of the
life of shepherds—of those, at least, about whom my master's lady used
to read, when I went to her house, in certain books, all treating of
shepherds and shepherdesses; and telling how they passed their whole
life in singing and playing on pipes and rebecks, and other old
fashioned instruments. I remember her reading how the shepherd of
Anfriso sang the praises of the peerless Belisarda, and that there was
not a tree on all the mountains of Arcadia on whose trunk he had not sat
and sung from the moment Sol quitted the arms of Aurora, till he threw
himself into those of Thetis, and that even after black night had spread
its murky wings over the face of the earth, he did not cease his
melodious complaints. I did not forget the shepherd Elicio, more
enamoured than bold, of whom it was said, that without attending to his
own loves or his flock, he entered into others' griefs; nor the great
shepherd Filida, unique painter of a single portrait, who was more
faithful than happy; nor the anguish of Sireno and the remorse of Diana,
and how she thanked God and the sage Felicia, who, with her enchanted
water, undid that maze of entanglements and difficulties. I bethought me
of many other tales of the same sort, but they were not worthy of being
remembered.</p>
<p>The habits and occupations of my masters, and the rest of the shepherds
in that quarter, were very different from those of the shepherds in the
books. If mine sang, it was no tuneful and finely composed strains, but
very rude and vulgar songs, to the accompaniment not of pipes and
rebecks, but to that of one crook knocked against another, or of bits of
tile jingled between the fingers, and sung with voices not melodious and
tender, but so coarse and out of tune, that whether singly or in chorus,
they seemed to be howling or grunting. They passed the greater part of
the day in hunting up their fleas or mending their brogues; and none of
them were named Amarillis, Filida, Galatea, or Diana; nor were there any
Lisardos, Lausos, Jacintos, or Riselos; but all were Antones, Domingos,
Pablos, or Llorentes. This led me to conclude that all those books about
pastoral life are only fictions ingeniously written for the amusement of
the idle, and that there is not a word of truth in them; for, were it
otherwise, there would have remained among my shepherds some trace of
that happy life of yore, with its pleasant meads, spacious groves,
sacred mountains, handsome gardens, clear streams and crystal fountains,
its ardent but no less decorous love-descants, with here the shepherd,
there the shepherdess all woe-begone, and the air made vocal everywhere
with flutes and pipes and flageolets.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Enough, Berganza; get back into your road, and trot on.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I am much obliged to you, friend Scipio; for, but for your hint,
I was getting so warm upon the scent, that I should not have stopped
till I had given you one whole specimen of those books that had so
deceived me. But a time will come when I shall discuss the whole matter
more fully and more opportunely than now.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Look to your feet, and don't run after your tail, that is to
say, recollect that you are an animal devoid of reason; or if you seem
at present to have a little of it, we are already agreed that this is a
supernatural and altogether unparalleled circumstance.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> That would be all very well if I were still in my pristine state
of ignorance; but now that I bethink me of what I should have mentioned
to you in the beginning of our conversation, I not only cease to wonder
that I speak, but I am terrified at the thought of leaving off.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Can you not tell me that something now that you recollect it?</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> It was a certain affair that occurred to me with a sorntess, a
disciple of la Camacha de Montilla.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Let me hear it now, before you proceed with the story of your
life.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> No, not till the proper time. Have patience and listen to the
recital of my adventures in the order they occurred, for they will
afford you more pleasure in that way.</p>
<p><i>Scip.</i> Very well; tell me what you will and how you will, but be brief.</p>
<p><i>Berg.</i> I say, then, that I was pleased with my duty as a guardian of
the flock, for it seemed to me that in that way I ate the bread of
industry, and that sloth, the root and mother of all vices, came not
nigh me; for if I rested by day, I never slept at night, the wolves
continually assailing us and calling us to arms. The instant the
shepherds said to me, "The wolf! the wolf! at him, Barcino," I dashed
forward before all the other dogs, in the direction pointed out to me by
the shepherds. I scoured the valleys, searched the mountains, beat the
thickets, leaped the gullies, crossed the roads, and on the morning
returned to the fold without having caught the wolf or seen a glimpse of
him, panting, weary, all scratched and torn, and my feet cut with
splinters; and I found in the fold either a ewe or a wether slaughtered
and half eaten by the wolf. It vexed me desperately to see of what
little avail were all my care and diligence. Then the owner of the flock
would come; the shepherds would go out to meet him with the skin of the
slaughtered animal: the owner would scold the shepherds for their
negligence, and order the dogs to be punished for cowardice. Down would
come upon us a shower of sticks and revilings; and so, finding myself
punished without fault, and that my care, alertness, and courage were of
no avail to keep off the wolf, I resolved to change my manner of
proceeding, and not to go out to seek him, as I had been used to do, but
to remain close to the fold; for since the wolf came to it, that would
be the surest place to catch him. Every week we had an alarm; and one
dark night I contrived to get a sight of the wolves, from which it was
so impossible to guard the fold. I crouched behind a bank; the rest of
the dogs ran forward; and from my lurking-place I saw and heard how two
shepherds picked out one of the fattest wethers, and slaughtered it in
such a manner, that it really appeared next morning as if the
executioner had been a wolf. I was horror-struck, when I saw that the
shepherds themselves were the wolves, and that the flock was plundered
by the very men who had the keeping of it. As usual, they made known to
their master the mischief done by the wolf, gave him the skin and part
of the carcase, and ate the rest, and that the choicest part,
themselves. As usual, they had a scolding, and the dogs a beating. Thus
there were no wolves, yet the flock dwindled away, and I was dumb, all
which filled me with amazement and anguish. O Lord! said I to myself,
who can ever remedy this villany? Who will have the power to make known
that the defence is offensive, the sentinels sleep, the trustees rob,
and those who guard you kill you?</p>
