<body class="x-ebookmaker x-ebookmaker-2"><p>"That can't be," said another of the women, "for there are no windows on
the street through which we could hear or see anybody."</p>
<p>"Never mind" said the negro; "there's a remedy for everything but
death. If you only could or would keep silence—"</p>
<p>"Keep silence! Ay that we will, brother Luis, as if we were born dumb. I
give you my word, friend, I am dying to hear a good voice, for ever
since we have been shut up here we have not even heard the birds sing."</p>
<p>Loaysa listened with great inward glee to this conversation, which
showed how readily the women were taking the very bent he would have
given them. The negro was afraid lest his master should return and catch
him talking with them; but they would not go away until he had promised
that, when they least expected it, he would call them to hear a capital
voice. He then retreated to his loft, where he would gladly have resumed
his lessons, but durst not do so by day for fear of detection. His
master returned soon after and went into the house, locking both doors
behind him as usual. When Luis went that day to the turning-box for his
victuals, he told the negress, who brought them, to let her
fellow-servants know that when their master was asleep that night, they
should all of them come down to the turning-box, when he would be sure
to give them the treat he had promised. He was enabled to say so much,
having previously entreated his music-master to condescend to sing and
play that night before the inner door for the amusement of the women.
The maestro suffered himself to be pressed very hard to do the thing he
most desired, but after much seeming reluctance he at last yielded to
the solicitations of his esteemed pupil, and said he would be happy to
oblige him. The negro embraced him cordially, in testimony of his
grateful sense of the promised favour, and treated him that day to as
good cheer as he could possibly have had at home, or perhaps better.</p>
<p>Towards midnight Luis knew, by the signals cautiously given at the
turning-box, that the women were all there; whereupon he and Loaysa went
down from the loft with the guitar, complete in all its strings and well
tuned. The maestro asked how many were there to hear him, and was told
that all the women in the house were there, except their lady, who was
in bed with her husband. This was not what Loaysa wished for,
nevertheless, by way of making a beginning and obliging his pupil, he
touched the guitar softly, and drew from it such tones as ravished the
ears of his audience. But who could describe the delight of the women
when he sang <i>Pesame de ello</i>, and followed it up with the magic strains
of the saraband, then new in Spain? There was not one of them that did
not keep time to the music as if she were dancing like mad, but all
noiselessly and with extreme caution, keeping scouts on the watch to
warn them if the old man awoke. Loaysa finally played them several
seguidillas, and so put the climax to his success, that they all eagerly
begged the negro to tell them who was this marvellous musician. Luis
replied that he was a poor beggar, but the most gallant and genteel man
in all the back slums of Seville. They conjured the negro to contrive
some means that they might see him, and not to let him quit the house
for a fortnight, for they would take care to supply him with the best of
good cheer, and plenty of it. They were curious to know how Luis had
managed to get him into the house; but to this the negro made no reply.
For the rest he told them that if they wanted to see the maestro, they
might bore a small hole in the turning-box and afterwards stop it up
with wax; and that as for keeping him in the house, he would do his
best.</p>
<p>Loaysa then addressed them, and offered them his services in such
obliging and polite terms, that they were sure such fine language never
came out of the head of a poor beggar. They entreated he would come the
next night, and they would prevail on their lady to come down and hear
him, in spite of the light sleep of her lord and master—the result not
so much of his age as of his extreme jealousy. Loaysa replied that if
they wished to hear him without fear of being surprised by the old man,
he would give them a powder to put in his wine, which would make him
sleep more soundly. "Good heaven!" cried one of the damsels, "if that
were true, what a blessing would have come home to us without our
knowing or deserving it! It would not be a sleeping powder for him so
much as it would be a powder of life for all of us, and for my poor dear
lady, Leonora his wife, to whom he sticks as close as her shadow, never
losing sight of her for a moment. Ah, señor of my soul! bring that
powder, and may God reward you with all the good you can desire. Go!
don't lose a moment—bring it, señor mio; I will take it upon me to put
it in his wine and to be his cupbearer. Oh, that it might please God
that the old man should sleep three days and nights! Three glorious days
and nights they would be for us."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll bring it then," said Loaysa. "It is of such a nature that it
does no harm to the person who takes it; the only effect of it being to
cause a most profound sleep."</p>
<p>They all entreated him to bring it without delay, and then they took
their leave of him, after agreeing that on the following night they
would make a hole in the turning-box with a gimlet, and that they would
try and persuade their mistress to come down. By this time it was nearly
daylight, yet the negro wished to take a lesson. Loaysa complied with
his desire, and assured him that among all the pupils he had ever
taught, he had not known one with a finer ear; and yet the poor negro
could never, to the end of his days, have learned the gamut.</p>
<p>Loaysa's friends took care to come at night to Carrizales' door to see
if their friend had any instructions to give them, or wanted anything.
On the second night, when they had made him aware of their presence by a
preconcerted signal, he gave them, through the key-hole, a brief account
of the prosperous beginning he had made, and begged they would try and
get him something to be given to Carrizales to make him sleep. He had
heard, he said, that there were powders which produced that effect. They
told him they had a friend, a physician, who would give them the best
drug for that purpose if he happened to have it; and after encouraging
him to persist in the enterprise, and promising to return on the
following night, they left him.</p>
<p>Presently the whole flock of doves came to the lure of the guitar, and
among them was the simple Leonora, trembling for fear her husband should
awake. So great was her dread of his discovering her absence, that her
women had great difficulty in persuading her to make the hazardous
venture. But they all, especially the dueña, told her such wonderful
things of the sweetness of the music, and the engaging manners of the
poor musician, whom, without having seen him, they extolled above
Absalom and Orpheus, that they persuaded her to do what she would never
have done of her own accord. Their first act was to bore a hole in the
turning-box through which they might peep at the musician, who was no
longer clad in rags, but in wide breeches of buff silk, cut sailor
fashion, a jacket of the same material, a satin cap to match, and a
starched double-pointed ruff, all which he had brought in his wallet,
expecting that he would have to show himself on an occasion which would
require him to change his costume. Loaysa was young, good-looking, and
of pleasing deportment; and as the eyes of all the women had been so
long accustomed only to the sight of old Carrizales, they fancied as
they looked at Loaysa that they beheld an angel.</p>
<p>Each of them took her turn at the peephole, and that they might see him
the better, the negro stood by him with a lighted flambeau, which he
moved up and down before the maestro's body. After all the women, from
the lady of the house down to the two negresses, had thus gratified
their eyes, Loaysa took his guitar, and played and sang more
bewitchingly than ever. Leonora's women were bewildered with delight,
and all besought Luis to contrive so that the señor maestro should come
in through the inner door, so that they might hear and see him better,
instead of squinting at him through a gimlet-hole, and without the risk
they ran of being caught in the fact by their master, which would not be
so great if they had the musician concealed inside. Their lady
strenuously opposed this proposition, declaring she would not permit any
such thing. She was shocked to hear them mention it, for they could hear
and see him well enough as it was, without danger to their honour.
"Honour," exclaimed the dueña; "the king has plenty. Your ladyship may
shut yourself up with your Methusalem, if you have a mind, but leave us
to amuse ourselves as well as we can; the more so since this señor
appears to be too much the gentleman to ask anything of us but what
would be pleasing to ourselves."</p>
<p>"Never!" interposed Loaysa. "I came hither, ladies, with no other
intention than to offer you my humble services, with all my heart and
soul, moved by commiseration for the unparalleled rigour of your
confinement, and for the precious moments that are lost to you through
this recluse way of life. By the life of my father, I am a man so
artless, so meek, so tractable and obedient, that I will never do more
than I am bidden. If any one of you should please to say, 'Maestro, sit
down here; Maestro, step this way, step that way, go yonder,' I will do
just as you bid me, like the tamest and best trained dog that jumps for
the king of France."</p>
<p>"Well, if that be so," said the inexperienced Leonora, "what is to be
done, so that the señor maestro may come in?"</p>
<p>"Nothing can be easier," said Loaysa. "So please you, ladies, just take
the trouble to make an impression on wax with the key of this door; and
I will take care that by to-morrow night another shall be made exactly
like it, which will answer our purpose."</p>
<p>"With that key," one of the women remarked, "we shall have those of the
whole house, for it is a master-key."</p>
<p>"So much the better," said Loaysa.</p>
<p>"That is true," said Leonora; "but this señor must first of all swear,
that when he is inside here he will not attempt to do anything but sing
and play when he is asked, and that he will keep close and quiet
wherever we may put him."</p>
<p>"I swear to this," said Loaysa.</p>
<p>"That oath is good for nothing," replied Leonora: "the señor must swear
by the life of his father, and by the cross, which he must kiss in sight
of us all."</p>
<p>"I swear by the life of my father," said Loaysa, "and by this sign of
the cross, which I kiss with my unworthy mouth;" and crossing two of his
fingers, he kissed them three times.</p>
<p>"That will do," said one of the women; "and now, señor, be sure you
don't forget the powder, for that is the main thing of all."</p>
<p>Here the conversation ended for that night, and all parties retired
highly satisfied with the interview. Good luck had evidently declared in
favour of Loaysa; and just then, about two o'clock in the morning, it
brought his friends to the door. On their giving the usual signal by
blowing a French horn, he went to the door, told them what progress he
had made, and asked had they brought the powder or other drug to put
Carrizales to sleep. At the same time, he spoke to them respecting the
master-key. They told him that on the following night they would bring
the powder, or else an ointment of such virtue that one had only to rub
the patient's wrists and temples with it to throw him into such a
profound sleep, that he would not wake for two days, unless the
anointed parts were well washed with vinegar. As to the key, he had
only to give them the impression in wax, and they would have a false one
made forthwith. Having said this, the friends retired, and Loaysa and
his pupil went to rest for the short remainder of the night. The next
day hung heavily on hand, as always happens to those who are filled with
eager expectation; but the longest day must have an end, and Loaysa's
impatient desire was at last gratified.</p>
<p>The appointed hour having arrived, all the domestics, great and small,
black and white, repaired to the turning-box, longing to see the señor
musico fairly within their seraglio; but no Leonora was there. When
Loaysa inquired for her, they said she was in bed with her good man, who
had locked the bed-room door, and put the key under his pillow; and that
their lady had told them, that when the old man had fallen asleep she
would take the key, and they were to go to her by and by for the wax
impression she would take from it, and pass to them through a trap-hole
in the door. Loaysa was astonished at the old man's extreme wariness, in
spite of which he by no means despaired of baffling his precautions.
Just then the French horn was heard: Loaysa hastened to the door, and
received from his friends a pot containing the promised ointment.
Bidding them wait awhile, and he would bring them the mould of the key,
he went back to the turning-box, and told the dueña, who seemed the most
eager of all the women for his admission, to give the ointment to her
lady, bid her anoint her husband with it so cautiously that he should
not be aware of what she was doing, and she would soon see wonders. The
dueña took the pot, stole up to her mistress's door, and found her
waiting on the inside, stretched full length on the floor, with her face
to the trap-hole. The dueña laid herself down in the same manner, and
putting her mouth to her mistress's ear, whispered that she had brought
the ointment, telling her at the same time how to apply it. Leonora took
the ointment, but told the dueña that she could by no means get the key,
for her husband had not put it under the pillow as usual, but between
the mattresses, just under where he lay. However, she was to tell the
maestro, that if the ointment operated as he said, she could easily get
the key as often as she pleased, and so there would be no need of
copying it in wax. Having delivered this message at once, the dueña was
to come back, and see how the ointment worked, for she intended to apply
it forthwith. The dueña having reported all this to Loaysa, he sent away
his friends who were waiting without for the mould of the key.</p>
<p>Trembling in every limb, and scarcely daring to breathe, Leonora began
to rub the wrists of her jealous husband. Next she smeared his nostrils;
but as she did so, the old man jerked his head, and Leonora was
petrified with terror, believing that he was awake, and had caught her
in the fact. It was a false alarm, however, and she went on with her
task the best way she could, till she had completed it according to her
instructions. It was not long before its effects manifested themselves;
for presently the old man began to snore loud enough to be heard in the
street. This was music more delightful to Leonora's ears than the
maestro's voice or guitar; but still hardly trusting what she saw, she
ventured to shake him, a very little at first, to see if he would wake;
and then a wee bit more and more, till finding that he still snored on,
she made bold to turn him over from one side to the other, without his
showing any signs of waking. Seeing this, she stepped joyfully to the
door; and in a voice not so low as before, called out to the dueña, who
was waiting with her ear to the trap-hole. "Good news, sister;
Carrizales is sleeping more soundly than the dead."</p>
<p>"What stops you then from taking the key, señora?" said the dueña. "The
musico has been waiting for it this hour and more."</p>
<p>"Stay a moment, sister; I am going for it," said Leonora; and stepping
back to the bed, she put her hand between the mattresses, and drew out
the key without the old man's perceiving it. No sooner was the key in
her hands, than dancing with delight she unlocked the door, and gave it
to the exulting dueña, bidding her let in the maestro, and bring him
into the gallery; but as for herself, she durst not stir from that spot,
for fear of what might happen. But before all things she insisted that
the maestro should ratify anew the oath he had taken not to do more than
they should order him; and if he would not give this renewed pledge, he
was not to be let in on any consideration.</p>
<p>"Never fear," said the dueña; "not a bit shall he come in until he has
sworn, and sworn again, and kissed the cross at least six times."</p>
<p>"Don't bind him to any fixed number," said Leonora; "but let him kiss
the cross as many times as he pleases; but be sure that he swears by the
life of his father, and by all he holds dear; for then we shall be safe
and sure, and we may take our fill of hearing him sing and play; and
exquisitely he does so, upon my word. There now, get you gone without
more delay, and let us not waste the night in words."</p>
<p>The good dueña caught up her petticoats, and ran with all her speed to
the turning-box, where the whole party was impatiently awaiting her; and
no sooner had she shown them the key in her hand, than they hoisted her
upon their shoulders, and paraded up and down with her, crying "Viva!
viva!" But still greater was their joy when she told them there was no
need to have a false key made; for so soundly did the old man sleep
after being anointed, that they might have the house-key as often as
they required it.</p>
<p>"Quick then, good friend," said one of the troop, "open the door, and
let in this gentleman who has been waiting so long, and let us have a
jolly bout of music, for that is all we have now to do."</p>
<p>"Nay, but there is more to be done," replied the dueña; "for we must
exact another oath of him; the same as last night."</p>
<p>"He is so good," said one of the slave girls, "that he won't grudge
taking as many oaths as we like."</p>
<p>The dueña now unlocked the door, and holding it ajar called to Loaysa,
who had been listening at the aperture to all that had passed. He was
for springing in at a bound; but the dueña stopped him, laying her hand
on his breast, and said, "Fair and softly, señor; I would have you to
know, as God is my judge, we are all of us virgins here as truly as the
mothers that bore us, except my lady; and I am one too, the Lord forgive
me, though you would take me for forty years old; but I am not thirty
all out, wanting two months and a fortnight of my thirtieth birthday;
and if I look older, it is that cares, and troubles, and vexations tell
upon one more than years. Now this being so, it does not stand to
reason, that for the sake of hearing two or three songs we should risk
the loss of so much virginity as is here collected together. And so you
see, my sweet sir, before you enter our domain, you must first take a
very solemn oath, that you will do nothing beyond our orders. If you
think it is much we ask of you, do but consider how much more it is we
risk; and if your intentions are good and proper, you will not be loth
to swear; for a good paymaster does not mind giving security."</p>
<p>"Well said, Marialonso," cried one of the damsels; "spoken like a person
of sense, and who knows what's what. If the señor won't swear, then let
him not come in here."</p>
<p>"Tell you what," said Guiomar, the negress, in her broken jargon,
"s'ppose him no swear, let him in all the same, in devil's name; for
s'ppose him swear, once him in, him forget eberyting."</p>
<p>Loaysa listened very demurely to the Señora Marialonso's harangue, and
replied with great gravity, "Be assured, ladies, my charming sisters and
companions, my intention never was, is, or shall be other than to
gratify and content you to the utmost of my powers; and therefore I make
no difficulty with regard to this oath which is required of me, though I
could have wished that some confidence had been reposed in my simple
word, which, given by such a person as I am, would have been as good as
a bond signed and sealed; for I would have you to know, ladies, that
under a bad cloak there is often a good drinker. But to the end that you
may all be assured of my upright intentions, I will take the oath as a
catholic and a man of parts. I swear then by the immaculate efficacy,
wherever it abides in greatest sanctity and fulness, by all the
entrances and exits of the holy mount Libanus, and by all that is
contained in the preface to the true history of Charlemagne, with the
death of the giant Fierabras, not to swerve or depart from the oath I
have taken, or from the commands which may be laid upon me by the least
of these ladies, under penalty, should I do otherwise, or attempt to do
otherwise, that from this time forth till then, and from thenceforth
till now, the same shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever."</p>
<p>When honest Loaysa had got so far in his oath, one of the young maidens,
who had listened to him with wrapt attention, cried out, "Well, if that
is not what you may call an oath! it is enough to melt the heart of a
stone. Plague take me if you shall swear any more for me; for after
such an oath as that you might enter the very cave of Cabra." So saying,
she caught hold of him by the breeches, and drew him within the door,
where the rest immediately gathered close round him. One of them ran off
with the news to her mistress, who stood watching her husband; and who,
when she heard that the musico was actually within doors, was moved
almost at the same moment by joy and fear, and hurriedly asked if he had
sworn. The girl told her he had done so, and with the most singular form
of oath she had ever heard in her life.</p>
<p>"Well, since he has sworn, we have him fast," said Leonora. "Oh, what a
good thought it was of mine to make him swear!"</p>
<p>They were now met by the whole party advancing in procession, with the
musico in the midst of them, and the negro and Guiomar lighting the way.
As soon as Loaysa saw Leonora, he threw himself at her feet to kiss her
hands; but without saying a word, she made signs to him to rise, and he
obeyed. Observing then that they all remained as mute as if they had
lost their tongues, Loaysa told them they might talk, and talk aloud
too; for there was no fear that their lord-master would wake and hear
them, such being the virtue of the ointment, that without endangering
life it made a man lie like one dead.</p>
<p>"That I fully believe," said Leonora; "for were it not so, he would have
been awake twenty times before this, such a light sleeper he is, in
consequence of his frequent indispositions; but ever since I anointed
him, he has been snoring like a pig."</p>
<p>"That being the case," said the dueña, "let us go into the saloon, where
we may hear the gentleman sing, and amuse ourselves a little."</p>
<p>"Let us go," said Leonora; "but let Guiomar remain here on the watch, to
warn vis if Carrizales wakes."</p>
<p>"Ay," said Guiomar, "black woman stay, white woman go: God pardon all."</p>
<p>Leaving the negress behind, the rest all went to the saloon, where they
seated themselves on a rich carpet, with Loaysa in the centre of the
group. Marialonso took a candle, and began to examine the figure of the
musician from bead to foot. Every one had something to say in his
commendation: "Oh, what a nice curly head of hair he has!" said one.
"What nice teeth!" cried another; "blanched almonds are nothing to
them." "What eyes!" exclaimed a third; "so large and full, and so green!
By the life of my mother, they look for all the world like emeralds."
Leonora alone said not a word; but as she looked at the maestro, she
could not help thinking that he was better looking than her good man.
Presently the dueña took the guitar out of the negro's hands, and
putting it into Loaysa's, begged he would sing to it a villanetta then
in high fashion at Seville. He complied; the women all jumped up, and
began to dance; whilst the dueña sang the words of the song with more
good will than good voice.</p>

<p>The song and the dance were just ended, when in rushed Guiomar in wild
affright, gesticulating as if she was in a fit, and in a voice between a
croak and a whisper, she stammered out, "Master wake, señora; señora,
master wake: him getting up, and coming." Whoever has seen a flock of
pigeons feeding tranquilly in the field, and has marked the fear and
confusion with which they take flight at the terrible sound of the gun,
may picture to himself the fluttering dismay of the dancers at the
unexpected news blurted out by Guiomar. Off they ran in all directions,
leaving the musico in the lurch, and in a pitiable state of perplexity.
Leonora wrung her beautiful hands; and the Señora Marialonso beat her
face, and tore her hair, but not with great violence. In short, all was
panic and confusion; but the dueña, who had more cunning and presence of
mind than the rest, directed that Loaysa should go into her own room,
whilst she and her mistress remained where they were, never doubting but
they should find some excuse or another to put off upon Carrizales.</p>
<p>Loaysa hid himself, and the dueña bent her ear to listen for her
master's footsteps; but hearing nothing, she took courage by degrees,
and stealing on tip-toe to his bed-room, she found him snoring there as
soundly as ever. Back she ran, at her best speed, to gladden her
mistress's heart with the joyful intelligence; and then discreetly
resolving not to lose so lucky an opportunity of being the first to
enjoy the good graces of the musico, she told Leonora to wait there
whilst she went and called him. Hastily entering the room where he was
concealed, she found him sorely discomfited by the untoward issue of his
adventure, cursing the inefficiency of the ointment, the credulity of
his friends, and his own want of forethought in not making an experiment
with the ointment on some other person before he tried its effect on
Carrizales. But when the dueña assured him that the old man was sleeping
as soundly as ever, there was an end to all his uneasiness, and he lent
a complacent ear to the very liquorish language in which Marialonso
addressed him. "Oho," said he to himself, "that's what you would be at,
is it? Well, you will do capitally as a bait to fish with for your
lady."</p>
<p>Whilst this <i>tête-à-tête</i> was pending, the rest of the women had one by
one crept out of their several hiding-places, to see if it was true that
their master was awake; and finding all still in the house, they
returned to the saloon where they had left their mistress. Having learnt
from her that the alarm had been a false one, they asked what had become
of the musico and the dueña. Leonora told them that Marialonso had gone
to fetch the maestro, whereupon they all stole out of the room as
noiselessly as they had entered it, and set themselves to listen at the
door to what was passing between the pair. Guiomar was one of the party,
but the negro was not among them; for upon the first alarm he had run
off, hugging his guitar, and hid himself in his loft, where he lay
huddled up under the bed-clothes, sweating with terror; in spite of
which he could not forbear from tinkling the guitar from time to time,
so inordinate—may Satanas confound him!—was his love of music. The
soft speeches of the amorous dueña were distinctly heard by the group
outside the door; and there was not one of them but bestowed a blessing
upon her from the wrong side of the mouth, with the addition of sundry
epithets which I had rather not repeat. The result of the confabulation
between the pair was that Loaysa would comply with the dueña's desires,
provided that first of all she brought her mistress to consent to his.
It cost the dueña something to subscribe to these conditions; but, after
all, there was nothing she would not have done to compass the
gratification of the desires that had laid hold on her soul and body,
and were undermining her very bones and marrow. The bargain was struck;
and quitting the room to go and speak to her mistress, she found all the
rest of the women assembled round the door. Putting a bold face on the
matter, she bade them all go to bed, and next night they should be able
to enjoy themselves without any such false alarm as had spoiled their
sport for that time. The women all knew well that the old dueña only
wanted to be left alone; but they could not help obeying her, for she
had command over them all.</p>
<p>Having got rid of the servants, the dueña went back to the saloon, and
began to exercise her powers of persuasion upon Leonora. She made her a
long and plausible harangue, so well put together that one might have
supposed she had composed it beforehand. She extolled the good looks of
the gentle musico, the elegance of his manners, his wondrous suavity,
and his countless other good qualities; represented how infinitely more
agreeable must be the caresses of such a charming young gallant than
those of the old husband; assured her the affair would never be
discovered, and plied her with a thousand other arguments which the
devil put into her mouth, all so specious and so artfully coloured, that
they might have beguiled the firmest mind, much more that of a being so
artless and unwary as poor Leonora. O dueñas, born and used for the
perdition of thousands of modest, virtuous beings! O ye long plaited
coifs, chosen to impart an air of grave decorum to the <i>salas</i> of noble
ladies, how do you reverse the functions of your perhaps needful office!
In fine, the dueña talked with such effect, that Leonora consented to
her own undoing, and to that of all the precautions of the wary
Carrizales, whose sleep was the death of his honour. Marialonso took her
mistress by the hand, led the weeping lady almost by force to Loaysa,
and wishing them much joy with a diabolical leer, she left them both
shut in together, and laid herself down in the saloon to sleep, or
rather to await the reward she had earned. Overcome, however, by the
loss of rest on two successive nights, she could not keep her eyes open,
but fell fast asleep on the carpet.</p>
<p>And now, if we did not know that Carrizales was asleep, it would not be
amiss to ask him, where now were all his jealous cares and precautions?
What now availed the lofty walls of his house, and the exclusion from it
of every male creature? What had he gained by his turning-box, his thick
walls, his stopped up windows, the enormously strict seclusion to which
he had doomed his family, the large jointure he had settled on Leonora,
the presents he was continually making her, his liberal treatment of her
attendants, and his unfailing alacrity in supplying them with everything
he imagined they could want or wish for? But as we have said, he was
asleep. Had he been awake, and disposed to reply, he could not have
given a better answer than by saying, as he shrugged his shoulders and
arched his eyebrows, that all this had been brought to nought by the
craft of an idle and vicious young man, and the wickedness of a
faithless dueña, working upon the weakness of an artless and
inexperienced girl. Heaven save us all from such enemies as these,
against whom the shield of prudence and the sword of vigilance are alike
impotent to defend us!</p>
<p>Such, nevertheless, was Leonora's rectitude, and so opportunely did she
manifest it, that all the villanous arts of the crafty seducer were of
no avail; till both of them, wearied by the contest, the baffled tempter
and the victorious defender of her own chastity, fell asleep almost at
the moment when it pleased Heaven that Carrizales should awake in spite
of the ointment. As usual he felt all about the bed, and not finding his
dear wife in it, he jumped up in the utmost consternation, and with
strange agility for a man of his years. He looked all over the room for
her, and when he found the door open, and the key gone from between the
mattresses, he was nearly distracted. Recovering himself a little, he
went out into the gallery, stole softly thence to the saloon, where the
dueña was asleep, and seeing no Leonora there, he went to the dueña's
own room, opened the door gently, and beheld Leonora in Loaysa's arms,
and both of them looking as if the soporific ointment was exerting its
influence over themselves instead of upon the jealous husband.</p>
<p>Carrizales was petrified with horror; his voice stuck in his throat; his
arms fell powerless by his sides, and his feet seemed rooted to the
ground; and though the fierce revulsion of his wrath presently aroused
his torpid senses, he yet could scarcely breathe, so intense was his
anguish. Thirsting for vengeance as terrible as his monstrous wrong, but
having no weapon at hand, he returned to his chamber as stealthily as he
had quitted it, in search of a dagger, with which he would wash out the
stain cast upon his honour in the blood of the guilty pair, and then
massacre his whole household; but he had no sooner reached his room than
his grief again overpowered him, and he fell senseless on the bed.</p>
<p>Day broke now, and found Leonora still in the arms of Loaysa. Marialonso
awoke, and thinking it time to receive what she counted was due to her,
she awoke Leonora, who was shocked to find it so late, and bitterly
accused her own imprudence and the dueña's negligence. With trembling
steps the two women crept up to Felipe's bedroom, praying inwardly to
Heaven that they might find him still snoring; and when they saw him
lying on the bed, apparently asleep, they made no doubt that he was
still under the effect of the opiate, and embraced each other in a
transport of joy. Leonora went up to her husband, and taking him by the
arm, turned him over on his side to see if he would wake without their
being obliged to wash him with vinegar according to the directions
given with the ointment; but the movement roused Carrizales from his
swoon, and heaving a deep sigh, he ejaculated in a faint and piteous
tone, "Miserable man that I am! to what a woeful pass I am come!"</p>
<p>Leonora did not distinctly hear what her husband said; but seeing with
surprise that the effect of the opiate was not so lasting as she had
been led to expect, she bent over him, put her cheek to his, and
pressing him closely in her arms, said, "What ails you, dear señor? You
seem to be complaining?"</p>
<p>Carrizales opened his eyes to their utmost width, and turning them full
upon her, stared at her a long while with a look of profound amazement.
At last he said, "Do me the pleasure, señora, to send instantly for your
parents in my name, and ask them to come hither, for I feel something at
my heart which distresses me exceedingly. I fear I have but a short time
to live, and I should like to see them before I die."</p>
<p>Leonora immediately despatched the negro with this message to her
parents. She fully believed what her husband had told her, and
attributing his danger to the violence of the opiate instead of to its
real cause, she put her arms round his neck, caressed him more fondly
than ever she had done before, and inquired how he felt, with such
tender solicitude, as if she loved him above everything in the world;
while he, on the other hand, continued to gaze upon her with the same
unvarying look of astonishment, every endearing word or caress of hers
being like a dagger to his heart. The dueña had, by this time,
acquainted Loaysa and the domestics with her master's illness, which,
she remarked, was evidently very serious, since he had forgotten to give
orders that the street door should be locked after the negro's departure
to summon her lady's parents. The message was itself a portentous
occurrence, for neither father nor mother had ever set foot within that
house since their daughter's marriage. In short, the whole household was
in anxiety, though no one divined the true cause of the old man's
illness. He lay sighing at intervals, so heavily that every sigh seemed
like the parting of soul and body. Leonora wept to see him in such a
state, whilst he beheld her feigned tears, as he deemed them, with a
bitter smile, that looked like the grin of insanity.</p>
<p>Leonora's parents now arrived, and were struck with no little
misgivings when they found both entrance doors open and the house all
lonely and silent. They went up to their son-in-law's room, and found
him in the posture he had all along maintained, with his eyes immovably
fixed on his wife, whom he held by the hands, whilst both were in tears;
she, because she saw his flow, and he at seeing how deceitfully she
wept. As soon as they entered the room, Carrizales begged them to be
seated, ordered all the domestics to withdraw except Marialonso, then
wiped his eyes, and with a calm voice and an air of perfect composure
addressed them thus:—</p>
<p>"I am sure, my respected father and mother-in-law, I need no other
witnesses than yourselves to the truth of what I have now to say to you
in the first place. You must well remember with how much love and what
tender affection I received your daughter when you bestowed her upon me
one year, one month, five days, and nine hours ago, as my lawful wife.
You know, also, with what liberality I behaved to her, for the
settlement I made upon her would have been more than enough to furnish
three young ladies of her quality with handsome marriage portions. You
must remember the pains I took to dress and adorn her with everything
she could desire or I could think of as suitable to her. It is known to
you likewise how, prompted by my natural disposition, fearful of the
evil to which I shall surely owe my death, and taught by the experience
of a long life to be on my guard against the many strange chances that
occur in life, I sought to guard this jewel which I had chosen and you
had bestowed upon me, with all possible care and caution. I raised the
walls of this house higher, blocked up all the windows that looked on
the street, doubled the locks of the doors, set up a turning-box as in a
nunnery, and perpetually banished from my dwelling every vestige of the
male sex. I gave my wife female servants and slaves to wait upon her: I
denied neither her nor them anything they chose to ask of me. I made her
my equal, communicated my most secret thoughts to her, and put my whole
property at her disposal. Having done all this, I thought I might fairly
expect to enjoy securely what had cost me so much, and that it would be
her care not to afford me cause for conceiving any kind of jealous fear
whatever. But it is not within the power of human efforts to prevent
the chastisement which Heaven is pleased to inflict on those who do not
rest their whole hopes and desires upon it alone. No wonder then if mine
have been deceived, and I have myself prepared the poison of which I am
now dying. But I see how anxiously you hang upon the words of my mouth.
I will therefore keep you no longer in suspense, but conclude this long
preamble by telling you, in one word, what no words were adequate to
describe, were I to speak for ever. This morning I found this woman,"
(here he pointed to his wife,) "who was born for the ruin of my peace
and the destruction of my life, in the arms of a young gallant, who is
now shut up in the bed-chamber of this pestilent dueña."</p>
<p>Carrizales had no sooner uttered these words than Leonora swooned, and
fell with her head upon his lap. Marialonso turned as white as ashes,
and Leonora's parents were so astounded that they could not utter a
word. After a short pause, Carrizales continued thus:—</p>
<p>"The vengeance I intend to take for this outrage shall be no common one.
As I have been singular in all my other actions, so will I be in this.
My vengeance shall fall upon myself, as the person most culpable of all,
for I ought to have considered how ill this girl's fifteen years could
assort with my threescore and ten. I have been like the silkworm, which
builds itself a house in which it must die. I do not reproach you,
misguided girl"—here he bent down and kissed his still insensible
wife—"for the persuasions of a wicked old woman, and the wheedling
tongue of an amorous youth, easily prevail over the little wit of a
green girl; but that all the world may see how strong and how true was
the love I bore you, I shall give such a proof of it here on my
death-bed, as the world has never seen or heard of;—one that shall
remain an unparalleled example, if not of goodness, at least of
singleness of heart. I desire that a notary be immediately sent for to
make my will, wherein I will double Leonora's jointure, and recommend
her, after my death, which will not be long delayed, to marry that young
man whom these gray hairs have never offended. Thus she will see that,
as in life I never departed in the slightest particular from what I
thought could please her, so I wish her to be happy when I am no more,
and to be united to him whom she must love so much. The rest of my
fortune I will bequeath to pious uses, after leaving to you both
wherewith to live honourably for the rest of your days. Let the notary
come instantly, for the anguish I am now suffering is such that, if it
continues, my time here will be very short."</p>
<p>Here Carrizales was seized with a terrible swoon, and sank down so close
to Leonora that their faces touched. During this scene the dueña stole
out of the room, and went to apprize Loaysa of all that had happened.
She advised him to quit the house immediately, and she would take care
to keep him informed of all that was going on, for there were no locked
doors now to hinder her from sending the negro to him whenever it was
necessary. Astounded at this news, Loaysa took her advice, put on his
beggar's rags again, and went away to make known to his friends the
strange issue of his amour.</p>
<p>Leonora's father, meanwhile, sent for a notary, who arrived soon after
both husband and wife had recovered their senses. Carrizales made his
will in the manner he had stated, without saying anything of his wife's
transgressions; he only declared that, for good reasons, he advised, and
begged her to marry, should he die, that young man of whom he had spoken
to her in private. When Leonora heard this, she threw herself at her
husband's feet, and cried, while her heart throbbed as if it would
burst, "Long may you live, my lord and my only joy; for though you may
not believe a word I say, indeed, indeed I have not offended you, except
in thought."</p>
<p>More she would have said, but when she attempted to exculpate herself by
a full statement of what had really occurred, her tongue failed her, and
she fainted away a second time. The poor old man embraced her as she
lay; so, too, did her parents—all three weeping bitterly; and even the
notary could not refrain from tears. Carrizales gave the negro and the
other slaves their liberty, and left all the servants enough to maintain
them; the perfidious Marialonso alone was to have nothing beyond the
arrears of her wages. Seven days afterwards Carrizales was laid in his
grave.</p>
<p>Leonora remained a mourning though wealthy widow; and whilst Loaysa
expected that she would fulfil the desire which he knew her husband had
expressed in his will, he learned that within a week she had become a
nun in one of the most austere and rigid convents in all Seville.
Mortified by this disappointment, he left the country and went to the
Indies. Leonora's father and mother were deeply grieved, but found
consolation in the wealth which their son-in-law had bequeathed them.
The two damsels likewise consoled themselves, as did the negro and the
female slaves, the former being well provided for, and the latter having
obtained their freedom; the wicked dueña alone was left to digest, in
poverty, the frustration of her base schemes. For my part I was long
possessed with the desire to complete this story, which so signally
exemplifies the little reliance that can be put in locks, turning-boxes,
and walls, whilst the will remains free; and the still less reason there
is to trust the innocence and simplicity of youth, if its ear be exposed
to the suggestions of your demure dueñas, whose virtue consists in their
long black gowns and their formal white hoods. Only I know not why it
was that Leonora did not persist in exculpating herself, and explaining
to her jealous husband how guiltless she had been in the whole of that
unhappy business. But her extreme agitation paralysed her tongue at the
moment, and the haste which her husband made to die, left her without
another opportunity to complete her justification.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00017"><a id="THE_ILLUSTRIOUS_SCULLERY_MAID"/>THE ILLUSTRIOUS SCULLERY-MAID.</h2>
<p>In the famous city of Burgos there lived two wealthy cavaliers, one of
whom was called Don Diego de Carriazo, and the other Don Juan de
Avendaño. Don Diego had a son called after himself, and Don Juan
another, whose name was Don Tomas de Avendaño. These two young gentlemen
being the principal persons of the following tale, we shall for the sake
of brevity call them Carriazo and Avendaño.</p>
<p>Carriazo might be about thirteen or little more, when, prompted by a
scampish disposition, without having had any cause to complain of bad
treatment at home, he ran away from his father's house, and cast himself
upon the wide world. So much did he enjoy a life of unrestricted
freedom, that amidst all the wants and discomforts attendant upon it, he
never missed the plenty of his father's house. He neither tired of
trudging on foot, nor cared for cold or heat. For him all seasons of the
year were genial spring. His sleep was as sound on a heap of straw as on
soft mattresses, and he made himself as snug in a hayloft as between two
Holland sheets. In short, he made such way in the profession he had
chosen, that he could have given lessons to the famous Guzman de
Alfarache.</p>
<p>During the three years he absented himself from home, he learned to play
at sheepshanks in Madrid, at <i>rentoy</i> in the public-houses of Toledo,
and at <i>presa y pinta</i> in the barbacans of Seville. In spite of the
sordid penury of his way of life, Carriazo showed himself a prince in
his actions. It was easy to see by a thousand tokens that he came of
gentle blood. His generosity gained him the esteem of all his comrades.
He seldom was present at drinking bouts; and though he drank wine, it
was in moderation, and he carried it well. He was not one of those
unlucky drinkers, who whenever they exceed a little, show it immediately
in their faces, which look as if they were painted with vermilion or red
ochre. In short, the world beheld in Carriazo a virtuous, honourable,
well-bred, rogue, of more than common ability. He passed through all
the degrees of roguery till he graduated as a master in the tunny
fisheries of Zahara, the chief school of the art. O kitchen-walloping
rogues, fat and shining with grease; feigned cripples; cutpurses of
Zocodober and of the Plaza of Madrid; sanctimonious patterers of
prayers; Seville porters; bullies of the Hampa, and all the countless
host comprised under the denomination of rogues! never presume to call
yourself by that name if you have not gone through two courses, at
least, in the academy of the tunny fisheries. There it is that you may
see converging as it were in one grand focus, toil and idleness, filth
and spruceness, sharp set hunger and lavish plenty, vice without
disguise, incessant gambling, brawls and quarrels every hour in the day,
murders every now and then, ribaldry and obscenity, singing, dancing,
laughing, swearing, cheating, and thieving without end. There many a man
of quality seeks for his truant son, nor seeks in vain; and the youth
feels as acutely the pain of being torn from that life of licence as
though he were going to meet his death. But this joyous life has its
bitters as well as its sweets. No one can lie down to sleep securely in
Zahara, but must always have the dread hanging over him of being carried
off to Barbary at any moment. For this reason, they all withdraw at
night into some fortified places on the coast, and place scouts and
sentinels to watch whilst they sleep; but in spite of all precautions,
it has sometimes happened that scouts, sentinels, rogues, overseers,
boats, nets, and all the posse comitatus of the place have begun the
night in Spain and have seen the dawn in Tetuan. No apprehensions of
this kind, however, could deter Carriazo from spending three successive
summers at the fisheries for his pastime; and such was his luck during
his third season, that he won at cards about seven hundred reals, with
which he resolved to buy himself good clothes, return to Burgos, and
gladden the heart of his sorrowing mother.</p>
<p>He took a most affectionate leave of his many dear friends, assuring
them that nothing but sickness or death should prevent his being with
them in the following summer; for his heart was in Zahara, and to his
eyes its parched sands were fresher than all the verdure of the Elysian
fields. Ambling merrily along on shanks' mare, he arrived at Valladolid,
where he stopped a fortnight to get rid of the mahogany hue of his
complexion, and to change his rogue's costume for that of a gentleman.
Having equipped himself properly, he had still a hundred reals left,
which he spent on the hire of a mule and a servant, that he might make a
good figure when he presented himself to his parents. They received him
with the utmost joy, and all the friends and relations of the family
came to congratulate them on the safe arrival of their son Don Diego de
Carriazo. I had forgotten to mention that, during his peregrination, Don
Diego had taken the name of Vidiales, and by that name alone he was
known to his new acquaintances.</p>
<p>Among those who came to see the new arrival were Don Juan de Avendaño
and his son Don Tomas, with the latter of whom, as they were both of the
same age and neighbours, Carriazo contracted a very close friendship.
Carriazo gave his parents a long and circumstantial account of all the
fine things he had seen and done during the three years he had been from
home, in all which there was not one word of truth; but he never so much
as hinted at the tunny fisheries, though they were constantly in his
thoughts, more especially as the time approached in which he had
promised his friends he would return to them. He took no pleasure in the
chase, with which his father sought often to divert him, nor in any of
the convivial meetings of that hospitable city. All kinds of amusements
wearied him, and the best enjoyments that could be offered to him were
not to be compared, he thought, with those he had known at the tunny
fisheries. His friend Avendaño, finding him often melancholy and musing,
ventured to inquire after the cause, at the same time professing his
readiness to assist his friend in any way that might be requisite, and
to the utmost of his power, even at the cost of his blood. Carriazo felt
that it would be wronging the great friendship subsisting between him
and Avendaño if he concealed from the latter the cause of his present
sadness; and therefore he described to him in detail the life he had led
at Zahara, and declared that all his gloom arose from his strong desire
to be there once more. So attractive was the picture he drew, that
Avendaño, far from blaming his taste, expressed his entire sympathy with
it. The end of the matter was that Avendaño determined to go off with
Carriazo, and enjoy for one summer that delicious life of which he had
just heard such a glowing description; and in this determination he was
strongly encouraged to persist by Carriazo, who was glad to be so
countenanced in his own low propensities. They set their wits to work to
see how they could scrape together as much money as possible, and the
best means that occurred to them was that suggested by Avendaño's
approaching departure for Salamanca, where he had already studied for
three years, and where his father wished him to complete his education,
and take a degree in whatever faculty he pleased. Carriazo now made
known to his father that he had a strong desire to go with Avendaño and
study at Salamanca. Don Diego gladly fell in with his son's proposal; he
talked with his friend Don Juan on the subject, and it was agreed
between them that the two young men should reside together at Salamanca,
and be sent thither well supplied with all requisites, and in a manner
suitable to the sons of men of quality.</p>
<p>The time for their departure being arrived, they were furnished with
money, and with a tutor who was more remarkable for integrity than for
mother wit. Their fathers talked much and impressively to their sons
about what they should do, and how they should govern themselves, in
order that they might become fraught with virtue and knowledge, for that
is the fruit which every student should aspire to reap from his labours
and his vigils, especially such as are of good family. The sons were all
humility and obedience; their mothers cried; both parents gave them
their blessing, and away they went, mounted on their own mules, and
attended by two servants of their respective households, besides the
tutor, who had let his beard grow, to give him a more imposing air of
gravity, as became his charge.</p>
<p>When they arrived at Valladolid, they told their tutor they should like
to remain there a couple of days to see the city, having never been in
it before. The tutor severely reprimanded them for entertaining any such
idle notion, telling them they had no time to lose in silly diversions;
that their business was to get as fast as possible to the place where
they were to pursue their studies; that he should be doing extreme
violence to his conscience if he allowed them to stop for one hour, not
to speak of two days; that they should continue their journey forthwith,
or, if not, then brown bread should be their portion.</p>
<p>Such was the extent of the ability in his office possessed by this
tutor, or major-domo, as we should rather call him. The lads, who had
already gathered in their harvest, since they had laid hands upon four
hundred gold crowns which were in the major-domo's keeping, begged that
he would let them remain in Valladolid for that day only, that they
might see the grand aqueducts, which were then in course of
construction, for the purpose of conveying the waters of Argales to that
city. He consented at last, but with extreme reluctance, for he wished
to avoid the expense of an additional day on the road, and to spend the
night at Valdiastellas, whence he could easily reach Salamanca in two
days. But the bay horse thinks one thing, and the man on his back
another thing, and so it proved in the major-domo's case. The lads,
mounted on two excellent mules, and attended by only one servant, rode
out to see the fountain of Argales, famous for its antiquity and the
abundance of its water. On their arrival there, Avendaño gave the
servant a sealed paper, bidding him return forthwith to the city, and
deliver it to his tutor, after which the servant was to wait for them at
the Puerta del Campo. The servant did as he was bid, and went back to
the city with the letter; and they, turning their mules' heads another
way, slept that night in Mojados, and arrived two days afterwards in
Madrid, where they sold their mules.</p>
<p>They dressed themselves like peasants in short jerkins, loose breeches,
and gray stockings. An old clothes dealer, to whom they sold their
handsome apparel in the morning, transformed them by night in such a
manner that their own mothers would not have known them. Lightly
equipped, as suited their purpose, and without swords, for they had sold
them to the old clothes dealer, they took to the road to Toledo. There
let us leave them for the present, stepping out briskly with merry
hearts, while we return to the tutor, and see him open the letter
delivered to him by the servant, which he read as follows:—</p>
<p>"Your worship, señor Pedro Alonso, will be pleased to have patience and
go back to Burgos, where you will say to our parents that we, their
sons, having with mature deliberation considered how much more arms
befit cavaliers than do letters, have determined to exchange Salamanca
for Brussels, and Spain for Flanders. We have got the four hundred
crowns; the mules we intend to sell. The course we have chosen, which is
so worthy of persons of our quality, and the length of the journey
before us, are sufficient to excuse our fault, though a fault it will
not be deemed by any one but a coward. Our departure takes place now;
our return will be when it shall please God, to whose keeping, we, your
humble pupils, heartily commend you. Given from the fountain of Argales,
with one foot in the stirrup for Flanders.</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 50%">"CARRIAZO,</span><br/>
<span style="margin-left: 50%">"AVENDANO."</span></p>
<p>Aghast at the contents of this letter, Pedro Alonso hurried to his
valise, and found that the paper spoke but too truly, for the money was
gone. Instantly mounting the remaining mule, he returned to Burgos to
carry these tidings to his patrons, in order that they might take
measures to recover possession of their sons' persons. But as to how he
was received, the author of this tale says not a word, for the moment he
has put Pedro Alonso into the saddle, he leaves him to give the
following account of what occurred to Avendaño and Carriazo at the
entrance of Illescas.</p>
<p>Just by the town gate they met two muleteers, Andalusians apparently,
one of whom was coming from Seville, and the other going thither. Said
the latter to the former, "If my masters were not so far ahead, I should
like to stop a little longer to ask you a thousand things I want to
know, for I am quite astonished at what you have told me about the
conde's having hanged Alonzo Gines and Ribera without giving them leave
to appeal."</p>
<p>"As I'm a sinner," replied the Sevillian, "the conde laid a trap for
them, got them under his jurisdiction—for they were soldiers, and once
having them in his gripe, the court of appeal could never get them out
of it. I tell you what it is, friend, he has a devil within him, that
same conde de Puñonrostro. Seville, and the whole country round it for
ten leagues, is swept clear of swash-bucklers; not a thief ventures
within his limits; they all fear him like fire. It is whispered,
however, that he will soon give up his place as corregidor, for he is
tired of being at loggerheads at every hand's turn with the señores of
the court of appeal."</p>
<p>"May they live a thousand years!" exclaimed he who was going to
Seville; "for they are the fathers of the miserable, and a refuge for
the unfortunate. How many poor fellows must eat dirt, for no other
reason than the anger of an arbitrary judge of a corregidor, either
ill-informed or wrong-headed! Many eyes see more than two; the venom of
injustice cannot so soon lay hold on many hearts as on one alone."</p>
<p>"You have turned preacher!" said he of Seville; "but I am afraid I can't
stop to hear the end of your sermon. Don't put up to night at your usual
place, but go to the Posada del Sevillano, for there you will see the
prettiest scullery-wench I know. Marinilla at the Venta Tejada is a
dishclout in comparison with her. I will only tell you that it is said
the son of the corregidor is very sweet upon her. One of my masters gone
on ahead there, swears, that on his way back to Andalusia, he will stop
two months in Toledo, and in that same inn, only to have his fill of
looking at her. I myself ventured once to give her a little bit of a
squeeze, and all I got for it was a swinging box on the ear. She is as
hard as a flint, as savage as a kestrel, and as touch-me-not as a
nettle; but she has a face that does a body's eyes good to look at. She
has the sun in one cheek, and the moon in the other; the one is made of
roses and the other of carnations, and between them both are lilies and
jessamine. I say no more, only see her for yourself, and you will see
that all I have told you is nothing to what I might say of her beauty.
I'd freely settle upon her those two silver gray mules of mine that you
know, if they would let me have her for my wife; but I know they won't,
for she is a morsel for an archbishop or a conde. Once more I say, go
and see her; and so, good-bye to you, for I must be off."</p>
<p>The two muleteers went their several ways, leaving the two friends much
struck by what they had overheard of the conversation, especially
Avendaño, in whom the mere relation which the muleteer had given of the
scullery-maid's beauty awoke an intense desire to see her. It had the
same effect on Carriazo, but not to an equal degree, nor so as to
extinguish his desire to reach his beloved tunny fisheries, from which
he would not willingly be delayed to behold the pyramids of Egypt, or
any or all of the other seven wonders of the world.</p>
<p>Repeating the dialogue between the muleteers, and mimicking their tones
and gestures, served as pastime to beguile the way until they reached
Toledo. Carriazo, who had been there before, led the way at once to the
Posada del Sevillano; but they did not venture to ask for accommodation
there, their dress and appearance not being such as would have gained
them a ready welcome. Night was coming on, and though Carriazo
importuned Avendaño to go with him in search of lodgings elsewhere, he
could not prevail on him to quit the doors of the Sevillano, or cease
from hanging about them, upon the chance that the celebrated
scullery-maid might perhaps make her appearance. When it was pitch dark
Carriazo was in despair, but still Avendaño stuck to the spot; and, at
last, he went into the courtyard of the inn, under pretence of inquiring
after some gentlemen of Burgos who were on their way to Seville. He had
but just entered the courtyard, when a girl, who seemed to be about
fifteen, and was dressed in working clothes, came out of one of the side
doors with a lighted candle. Avendaño's eyes did not rest on the girl's
dress, but on her face, which seemed to him such as a painter would give
to the angels; and so overcome was he by her beauty, that he could only
gaze at it in speechless admiration, without being able to say one word
for himself.</p>
<p>"What may you please to want, brother?" said the girl. "Are you servant
to one of the gentlemen in the house?"</p>
<p>"I am no one's servant but yours," replied Avendaño, trembling with
emotion.</p>
<p>"Go to, brother," returned the girl disdainfully, "we who are servants
ourselves have no need of others to wait on us;" and calling her master,
she said, "Please to see, sir, what this lad wants."</p>
<p>The master came out, and, in reply to his question, Avendaño said that
he was looking for some gentlemen of Burgos who were on their way to
Seville. One of them was his master, and had sent him on before them to
Alcalá de Henares upon business of importance, bidding him, when that
was done, to proceed to Toledo, and wait for him at the Sevillano; and
he believed that his master would arrive there that night or the
following day at farthest.</p>
<p>So plausibly did Avendaño tell this fib that the landlord was quite
taken in by it. "Very well, friend," said he, "you may stop here till
your master comes."</p>
<p>"Many thanks, señor landlord," replied Avendaño; "and will your worship
bid them give me a room for myself, and a comrade of mine who is
outside? We have got money to pay for it, as well as another."</p>
<p>"Certainly," said the host, and turning to the girl he said, "Costanza,
bid la Argüello take these two gallants to the corner room, and give
them clean sheets."</p>
<p>"I will do so, señor," and curtsying to her master she went away,
leaving Avendaño by her departure in a state of feeling like that of the
tired wayfarer when the sun sets and he finds himself wrapt in cheerless
darkness. He went, however, to give an account of what he had seen and
done to Carriazo, who very soon perceived that his friend had been
smitten in the heart; but he would not say a word about the matter then,
until he should see whether there was a fair excuse for the hyperbolical
praises with which Avendaño exalted the beauty of Costanza above the
stars.</p>
<p>At last they went in doors, and la Argüello, the chamber maid, a woman
of some five-and-forty years of age, showed them a room which was
neither a gentleman's nor a servant's, but something between the two. On
their asking for supper, la Argüello told them they did not provide
meals in that inn; they only cooked and served up such food as the
guests bought and fetched for themselves; but there were eating-houses
in the neighbourhood, where they might without scruple of conscience go
and sup as they pleased. The two friends took la Argüello's advice, and
went to an eating-house, where Carriazo supped on what they set before
him, and Avendaño on what he had brought with him, to wit, thoughts and
fancies. Carriazo noticed that his friend ate little or nothing, and, by
way of sounding him, he said on their way back to the inn, "We must be
up betimes to-morrow morning, so that we may reach Orgez before the heat
of the day."</p>
<p>"I am not disposed for that," replied Avendaño, "for I intend, before I
leave this city, to see all that is worth seeing in it, such as the
cathedral, the waterworks of Juanelo, the view from the top of St.
Augustine's, the King's garden, and the promenade by the river."</p>
<p>"Very well, we can see all that in two days."</p>
<p>"What need of such haste? We are not posting to Rome to ask for a vacant
benefice."</p>
<p>"Ha! ha! friend, I see how it is, I'll be hanged if you are not more
inclined to stay in Toledo than to continue our journey."</p>
<p>"That's true, I confess; it is as impossible for me to forego the sight
of that girl's face, as it is to get into heaven without good works."</p>
<p>"Gallantly spoken, and as becomes a generous breast like yours! Here's a
pretty story! Don Tomas de Avendaño, son of the wealthy and noble
cavalier, Don Juan de Avendaño, over head and ears in love with the
scullery-maid at the Posada del Sevillano!"</p>
<p>"It strikes me, I may answer you in the same strain. Here's Don Diego de
Carriazo, son and sole heir of the noble knight of Alcántara of the same
name, a youth finely gifted alike in body and mind, and behold him in
love—with whom, do you suppose? With queen Ginevra? No such thing, but
with the tunny fisheries of Zahara, and all its rogues and rascals,—a
more loathsome crew, I suspect, than ever beset St. Anthony in his
temptations."</p>
<p>"You have given me tit for tat, friend, and slain me with my own weapon.
Let us say no more now, but go to bed, and to-morrow who knows but we
come to our senses?"</p>
<p>"Look ye, Carriazo, you have not yet seen Costanza; when you have seen
her, I will give you leave to say what you like to me."</p>
<p>"Well, I know beforehand what will be the upshot of the matter."</p>
<p>"And that is?"</p>
<p>"That I shall be off to my tunny fisheries, and you will remain with
your scullery-maid."</p>
<p>"I shall not be so happy."</p>
<p>"Nor I such a fool as to give up my own good purpose for the sake of
your bad one."</p>
<p>By this time they reached the inn, where the conversation was prolonged
in the same tone, half the night long. After they had slept, as it
seemed to them, little more than an hour, they were awakened by the loud
sound of clarions in the street. They sat up in bed, and after they had
listened awhile, "I'll lay a wager," said Carriazo, "that it is already
day, and that there is some feast or other in the convent of Nostra
Señora del Carmen, in this neighbourhood, and that is why the clarions
are pealing."</p>
<p>"That can't be," said Avendaño; "we have not been long asleep. It must
be some time yet till dawn."</p>
<p>While they were talking, some one knocked at the door, and called out,
"Young men, if you want to hear some fine music, go to the window of the
next room, which looks on the street; it is not occupied."</p>
<p>They got up and opened the door, but the person who had spoken was gone.
The music still continuing, however, they went in their shirts, just as
they were, into the front room, where they found three or four other
lodgers, who made place for them at the window; and soon afterwards an
excellent voice sang a sonnet to the accompaniment of the harp. There
was no need of any one to tell Carriazo and Avendaño that this music was
intended for Costanza, for this was very clear from the words of the
sonnet, which grated so horribly on Avendaño's ears, that he could have
wished himself deaf rather than have heard it. The pangs of jealousy
laid hold on him, and the worst of all was, that he knew not who was his
rival. But this was soon made known to him when one of the persons at
the window exclaimed, "What a simpleton is the corregidor's son, to make
a practice of serenading a scullery-maid. It is true, she is one of the
most beautiful girls I have ever seen, and I have seen a great many; but
that is no reason why he should court her so publicly."</p>
<p>"After all," said another, "I have been told for certain that she makes
no more account of him than if he never existed. I warrant she is this
moment fast asleep behind her mistress's bed, without ever thinking of
all this music."</p>
<p>"I can well believe it," said the first speaker, "for she is the most
virtuous girl I know; and it is marvellous that though she lives in a
house like this, where there is so much traffic, and where there are new
comers every day, and though she goes about all the rooms, not the least
thing in the world is known to her disparagement."</p>
<p>Avendaño began to breathe more freely after hearing this, and was able
to listen to many fine things which were sung to the accompaniment of
various instruments, all being addressed to Costanza, who, as the
stranger said, was fast asleep all the while.</p>
<p>The musicians departed at the approach of dawn. Avendaño and Carriazo
returned to their room, where one of them slept till morning. They then
rose, both of them eager to see Costanza, but the one only from
curiosity, the other from love. Both were gratified; for Costanza came
out of her master's room looking so lovely, that they both felt that all
the praises bestowed on her by the muleteer, fell immeasurably short of
her deserts. She was dressed in a green bodice and petticoat, trimmed
with the same colour. A collar embroidered with black silk set off the
alabaster whiteness of her neck. The thick tresses of her bright
chestnut hair were bound up with white ribbon; she had pendents in her
ears which seemed to be pearls, but were only glass; her girdle was a
St. Francis cord, and a large bunch of keys hung at her side. When she
came out of the room she crossed herself, and made a profound reverence
with great devotion to an image of our Lady, that hung on one of the
walls of the quadrangle. Then looking up and seeing the two young men
intently gazing on her, she immediately retired again into the room, and
called thence to Argüello to get up.</p>
<p>Carriazo, it must be owned, was much struck by Costanza's beauty; he
admired it as much as his companion, only he did not fall in love with
her; on the contrary, he had no desire to spend another night in the
inn, but to set out at once for the fisheries.</p>
<p>La Argüello presently appeared in the gallery with two young women,
natives of Gallicia, who were also servants in the inn; for the number
employed in the Sevillano was considerable, that being one of the best
and most frequented houses of its kind in Toledo. At the same time the
servants of the persons lodging in the inn began to assemble to receive
oats for their masters' beasts; and the host dealt them out, all the
while grumbling and swearing at his maid-servants who had been the cause
of his losing the services of a capital hostler, who did the work so
well and kept such good reckoning, that he did not think he had ever
lost the price of a grain of oats by him. Avendaño, who heard all this,
seized the opportunity at once. "Don't fatigue yourself, señor host," he
said; "give me the account-book, and whilst I remain here I will give
out the oats, and keep such an exact account of it that you will not
miss the hostler who you say has left you."</p>
<p>"Truly I thank you for the offer, my lad," said the host, "for I have no
time to attend to this business; I have too much to do, both indoors
and out of doors. Come down and I will give you the book; and mind ye,
these muleteers are the very devil, and will do you out of a peck of
oats under your very nose, with no more conscience than if it was so
much chaff."</p>
<p>Avendaño went down to the quadrangle, took the book, and began to serve
out pecks of oats like water, and to note them down with such exactness
that the landlord, who stood watching him, was greatly pleased with his
performance. "I wish to God," he said, "your master would not come, and
that you would make up your mind to stop with me; you would lose nothing
by the change, believe me. The hostler who has just quitted me came here
eight months ago all in tatters, and as lean as a shotten herring, and
now he has two very good suits of clothes, and is as fat as a dormouse;
for you must know, my son, that in this house there are excellent vails
to be got over and above the wages."</p>
<p>"If I should stop," replied Avendaño, "I should not stand out much for
the matter of what I should gain, but should be content with very little
for sake of being in this city, which, they tell me, is the best in
Spain."</p>
<p>"At least it is one of the best and most plentiful," said the host. "But
we are in want of another thing, too, and that is a man to fetch water,
for the lad that used to attend to that job has also left me. He was a
smart fellow, and with the help of a famous ass of mine he used to keep
all the tanks overflowing, and make a lake of the house. One of the
reasons why the muleteers like to bring their employers to my house is,
that they always find plenty of water in it for their beasts, instead of
having to drive them down to the river."</p>
<p>Carriazo, who had been listening to this dialogue, and who saw Avendaño
already installed in office, thought he would follow his example, well
knowing how much it would gratify him. "Out with the ass, señor host,"
he said; "I'm your man, and will do your work as much to your
satisfaction as my comrade."</p>
<p>"Aye, indeed," said Avendaño, "my comrade, Lope Asturiano will fetch
water like a prince, I'll go bail for him."</p>
<p>La Argüello, who had been all the while within earshot, here put in her
word. "And pray, my gentleman," said she to Avendaño, "who is to go bail
for you? By my faith, you look to me as if you wanted some one to
answer for you instead of your answering for another."</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue, Argüello," said her master; "don't put yourself
forward where you're not wanted. I'll go bail for them, both of them.
And mind, I tell you, that none of you women meddle or make with the
men-servants, for it is through you they all leave me."</p>
