<p>Among the spoils which the English carried off from the city of
Cadiz,<a id="FNanchor_78_78"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_78_78" class="pginternal"><sup>[78]</sup></a> was a little girl of about seven years old. An English
gentleman, named Clotald, commander of a squadron of vessels, took her
to London without the knowledge of the Earl of Essex, and in defiance of
his general orders. The parents complained to the earl of the loss of
their child, and implored him, since he had declared that property alone
should be seized, and the persons of the inhabitants should be left
free, they should not, besides being reduced to poverty, suffer the
additional misery of being deprived of their daughter, who was the very
light of their eyes. The earl caused it to be proclaimed throughout his
whole army, that whoever had possession of the child, should restore her
on pain of death; but no threatened penalties could constrain Clotald to
obey; in spite of them, he kept the child concealed in his ship, being
fascinated, though in a Christian manner, with the incomparable beauty
of Isabella, as she was called. In fine, her inconsolable parents were
left to mourn her loss, and Clotald, rejoicing beyond measure, returned
to London, and presented the pretty child to his wife, as the richest
prize he had brought home from the war.</p>
<p>It happened fortunately that all the members of Clotald's household were
catholics in secret, though in public they affected to follow the
religion of the state. Clotald had a son about twelve years old, named
Richard, who was brought up by his parents to love and fear God, and to
be very stedfast in the truths of the catholic faith. Catherine, the
wife of Clotald, a noble, Christian, and prudent lady, conceived such an
affection for Isabella, that she reared her as if she was her own
daughter; and the child was so well endowed by nature, that she readily
learned all they taught her. Time and the kind treatment she received,
gradually wore out from her recollection that which her parents had
bestowed upon her; not so much so, however, but that she often thought
of them with a sigh. Though she learned English, she did not forget her
native tongue, for Clotald took care to bring Spaniards secretly to his
house to converse with her, and thus it was, that without ceasing to
speak Spanish, she became as proficient in English as if she had been
born in London.</p>
<p>After having learned all kinds of work becoming a young lady of good
birth, she was taught to read and write more than passably well; but
what she excelled in above all, was in playing all sorts of instruments
suitable to her sex, with extraordinary perfection of musical taste and
skill, and with the accompaniment of a voice which Heaven had endowed
with such melody that when she chanted she enchanted. All these graces,
natural and acquired, gradually inflamed the heart of Richard, whom she
loved and respected as the son of her lord. At first his affection for
her was like that of a brother for a sister, but when she reached her
twelfth year, this feeling had changed into a most ardent desire to
possess her, but only in the honourable way of becoming her lawful
spouse; for Isabella's incomparable virtue made it hopeless to obtain
her in any other way, nor would he have done so even, if he could, for
his own noble disposition, and the high estimation in which he held her,
forbade any bad thought to take root in his soul.</p>
<p>A thousand times he determined to make known his passion to his father
and mother, and as often broke his resolution, knowing that they had
destined him to be the husband of a young Scotch lady of great wealth
and good family, who, like themselves, secretly professed the catholic
faith; and it seemed clear to him, that after having betrothed him to a
lady of rank, they would not think of bestowing him on a slave, if that
name could be applied to Isabella. Agitated by these distressing
reflections, not knowing what course to pursue or whom to consult, he
fell into a melancholy that nearly cost him his life. But thinking it
was a very cowardly thing to let himself die without making any kind of
effort for his own relief, he strove to gather up courage enough to
declare his feelings to Isabella.</p>
<p>Everybody in the house was grieved for Richard's illness for he was
beloved by them all, and by his parents to the utmost degree, both
because he was their only child, and because his virtues, his worth, and
good sense deserved all their affection. The physicians could not make
out the nature of his complaint, nor could he himself venture to declare
it. At last, one day when Isabella entered his room alone, to attend
upon him, he said to her, with a faltering voice and stammering tongue,
"Lovely Isabella, your worth, your great virtue, and exceeding beauty,
have brought me to the state you see; if you would not have me perish in
the worst agonies that can be imagined, say that you return the love I
feel for you, and consent to my fondest desire, which is to make you
secretly my wife; for I fear that my parents, not knowing your merits as
I do, would refuse me a blessing to me so indispensable. If you will
give me your word to be mine, I here pledge you my own, as a true
catholic Christian, to be yours; and though our union be deferred, as
deferred it shall be until it can take place with the church's sanction
and that of my parents, yet the thought that you will surely be mine,
will be enough to restore me to health, and to keep my spirits buoyant
until the happy day arrives."</p>
<p>Whilst Richard was speaking, Isabella stood with downcast eyes, and when
he had ceased, she replied with equal modesty and good sense, "Ever
since Heaven, in its anger or its mercy (I know not which), withdrew me
from my parents, Se√±or Richard, and gave me to yours, I have resolved,
in gratitude for the infinite kindness they have bestowed upon me, never
to act in opposition to their wishes; and without their consent, I
should regard the inestimable boon you desire to confer upon me, not as
a good but as an evil fortune. Should it ever be my happy destiny to be
acknowledged by them as worthy of you, be assured that my heart shall be
yours; but till that time comes, or should it never come, let it console
you to know that the dearest wish of my soul will ever be that you may
know every blessing which Heaven can bestow upon you." She said no more,
but from that moment began the convalescence of Richard, and the revival
of his parents' drooping hopes.</p>
<p>The youthful pair took courteous leave of each other, he with tears in
his eyes, and she wondering in her soul to see that of Richard captive
to her love. As for him, having been raised from his sick bed by a
miracle, as it seemed to his parents, he would no longer conceal from
them the state of his feelings, but disclosed it one day to his mother,
and ended a long conversation by declaring that they might as well put
him to death as refuse him Isabella, for it amounted to the same thing.
He extolled the virtues of Isabella in such terms, that he almost
brought his mother to think that in becoming her son's wife she would
have the worst of the bargain. Accordingly she gave Richard good hopes
that she would prevail on his father to assent to his wishes, as she
herself did; in this she succeeded, for by repeating to her husband all
Richard's arguments, she easily induced him to approve of the young
man's design, and to find excuses for breaking off the match with the
Scotch lady.</p>
<p>At this time Isabella was fourteen and Richard twenty; but even in that
early spring time of their youth, they were old in sense and judgment.
It wanted but four days of the time appointed by Richard's parents when
he should bend his neck to the holy yoke of matrimony; and wise and
fortunate did they deem themselves in choosing their prisoner to be
their daughter, esteeming her virtues to be a better dower than the
great wealth of the Scotch lady. The preparations for the wedding were
all made, the relations and friends of the family were invited, and
nothing remained but to make known the intended match to the Queen, no
marriage between persons of noble blood being lawful without her
knowledge and consent; but making no doubt of obtaining the royal
licence, they put off applying for it to the last. Things being in this
state, their joy was disturbed one evening by the appearance of one of
the Queen's servants with an order to Clotald from her Majesty,
requiring his appearance before her next morning with his Spanish
prisoner. He replied that he would cheerfully obey her Majesty's
command. The messenger retired, and left the family in great
perturbation; "Alas," said dame Catherine, "what if the Queen knows that
I have brought up this girl as a Catholic, and thence infers that we are
all of us Christians in this house! For, if her Majesty asks her what
she has learned during the eight years she has been with us, what
answer can she give with all her discretion, poor timid girl, that will
not condemn us?"</p>
<p>"Be under no fear on that account, dear lady," said Isabella; "for I
trust in the divine goodness and mercy of Heaven, that it will put such
words into my mouth as will not only not condemn you, but redound to
your advantage."</p>
<p>Richard trembled as if he foreboded some calamity. Clotald cast about
for some encouragement to allay his grievous fears, and found none but
in his great trust in God and in the prudence of Isabella, whom he
earnestly entreated to try in every possible way to avoid convicting
them of being Catholics; for, though their spirits were willing to
encounter martyrdom, yet their flesh was weak and recoiled from the
bitter trial. Isabella assured them over and over again that they might
set their minds at rest; what they apprehended should not befal them
through her instrumentality; for though she knew not then what answer
she should make to the questions that should be put to her on the
morrow, she had a lively and confident hope that she would reply in such
a manner as would be for their good.</p>
<p>Many were the comments and surmises they made that night on this
unwelcome incident, and especially it occurred to them that, if the
Queen knew they were Catholics, she would not have sent them so mild a
message; it seemed reasonable to infer from it, that she only desired to
see Isabella, the fame of whose incomparable beauty and accomplishments,
known to every one in the capital, must have reached her Majesty's ears.
Clotald and his wife confessed to themselves, however, that they had
done wrong in not presenting her at court, and they thought the best
excuse they could make for this, was to say that ever since she had come
into their hands, they had destined her to be the wife of their son. But
even this would be acknowledging themselves culpable, since it would
appear that they arranged the marriage without the Queen's leave; but
such an offence would probably not incur any severe punishment. In this
way, they comforted themselves, and they resolved that Isabella should
not be dressed humbly like a prisoner, but in rich bridal attire, such
as became the betrothed of a gentleman of importance Ike their son.
Next day accordingly they dressed Isabella in the Spanish style, in a
robe of green satin with a long train, and slashes lined with cloth of
gold and looped with the pearls, the whole being adorned with precious
stones; a diamond necklace and girdle, with a fan such as is carried by
Spanish ladies; and for head dress her own luxuriant golden hair
entwined with diamonds and pearls.</p>
<p>In that sumptuous attire, with her sprightly air and marvellous beauty,
she made her appearance in London in a handsome coach, fascinating the
eyes and souls of all who beheld her. Clotald, his wife, and Richard
rode with her in the coach, and many noble relations of the family
escorted her on horseback, Clotald desiring that all these honours
should be paid to his prisoner, in order that the queen might treat her
as his son's betrothed. When they arrived at the palace, and entered the
vast hall in which her majesty was seated, Isabella's escort halted at
the lower end, and she herself advanced alone in all her inconceivable
beauty, producing an effect like that of a brilliant meteor shooting
through the sky on a calm clear night, or of a sunbeam darting at the
first dawn of day through a mountain gorge. A comet she seemed,
portending a fiery doom to the hearts of many in that presence hall.
Full of meekness and courtesy, she advanced to the foot of the throne,
knelt before the queen, and said to her in English, "May it please your
Majesty to extend your royal hands to your servant's lips, who will
henceforth esteem herself exalted, since she has been so fortunate as to
behold your grandeur."</p>
<p>The queen remained a good while gazing on her without saying a word,
figuring to herself, as she afterwards told her lady of the bed-chamber,
that she had before her a starry heaven, the stars of which were the
many pearls and diamonds worn by Isabella; her fair face and her eyes
its sun and moon, and her whole person a new marvel of beauty. The
queen's ladies would fain have been all eyes, that they might do nothing
but gaze on Isabella; one praised her brilliant eyes, one her
complexion, another her fine figure, another her sweet voice; and one
there was who said in pure envy, "The Spaniard is good looking, but I do
not like her dress."</p>
<p>At last the queen motioned to Isabella to rise, and said to her, "Speak
to me in Spanish, maiden, for I understand it well, and shall like to
hear it." Then turning to Clotald, "You have done me wrong, Clotald,"
she said, "in keeping this treasure so many years concealed from me; but
it is such a one as may well have excited you to avarice. You are bound
however to restore it to me, for by right it is mine."</p>
<p>"My liege," replied Clotald, "what your majesty says is quite true; I
confess my fault, if it is one, to have kept this treasure until it
arrived at the perfection suitable for appearing before your majesty's
eyes. Now that it has done so, I had it in mind to enhance it still
more, by asking your majesty's leave for Isabella to become the wife of
my son Richard."</p>
<p>"I like her name, too," returned the queen. "Nothing was wanting to the
fulness of her perfection but that she should be called Isabella the
Spaniard. But, mark you, Clotald, I know that, without my leave, you
have promised her to your son."</p>
<p>"That is true, my liege, but it was in the confident hope that the many
eminent services which my ancestors and I have rendered to the crown,
would obtain from your majesty favours still more difficult to grant
than the leave in question, the more so as my son is not yet wedded."</p>
<p>"Nor shall he be wedded to Isabella," said the queen, "until he has
merited it in his own person. I mean that I will not have him avail
himself to that end of your services or those of his forefathers. He
must himself prepare to serve me, and win by his own deserts this prize
which I esteem as if she were my daughter."</p>
<p>The queen had no sooner uttered these last words than Isabella again
fell on her knees before her, saying in Spanish, "Such thwartings as
these, most gracious sovereign, are rather to be esteemed auspicious
boons than misfortunes. Your majesty has given me the name of daughter;
after that what can I have to fear, or what may I not hope?"</p>
<p>Isabella uttered this with so winning a grace, that the queen conceived
an extreme affection for her, desired that she should remain in her
service, and committed her to the care of a great lady, her keeper of
the robes, who was to instruct her in the duties of her new position.</p>
<p>Richard, who saw himself thus, as it were, deprived of his life in
losing Isabella, was almost at his wits' end. Agitated and discomfited,
he knelt before the queen, and said, "I need no other rewards to induce
me to serve your majesty than such as my ancestors have obtained in the
service of your royal predecessors; but since it is your majesty's
pleasure that I should have new motives and incentives for my zeal, I
would crave to know in what way I may fulfil your majesty's behest?"</p>
<p>"There are two ships ready to set out on a cruise," said the queen, "of
which I have made the Baron de Lansac general. I appoint you captain of
one of them, being assured that the qualities you derive from those
whose blood is in your veins will supply the defect of your years. Mark
what a favour I confer upon you, since I give you an opportunity to
signalise yourself in the service of your queen, to display your
capacity and your valour, and to win the highest reward, methinks, which
you yourself could desire. I myself will be Isabella's guardian, though
she manifests that her own virtue will be her truest guardian. Go in
God's name; for since you are in love, as I imagine, I expect great
things from your prowess. Fortunate were the king who in time of war had
in his army ten thousand soldiers in love, expecting to obtain their
mistresses as the reward of their victories. Rise, Richard, and if you
have anything to say to Isabella, say it now, for to-morrow you must
sail."</p>
<p>Richard kissed the queen's hands, highly prizing the favour she had
conferred upon him, and went and knelt before Isabella. He tried to
speak to her, but could not, for he felt as if there was a knot in his
throat that paralysed his tongue. He strove with all his might to keep
down the tears that started into his eyes, but he could not conceal them
from the queen. "Shame not to weep, Richard," said her majesty, "nor
think less of yourself for allowing such evidence of a tender heart to
escape you, for it is one thing to fight the enemy, and another to take
leave of one who is dearly loved. Isabella, embrace Richard, and give
him your blessing: his affection well deserves it."</p>
<p>Isabella's heart ached to see Richard so cast down. She could not
understand what her majesty said. Conscious of nothing but her grief,
motionless, and blinded by her tears, she looked like a weeping statue
of alabaster. The anguish of the two lovers drew tears from most of the
beholders. In fine, Richard and Isabella separated without exchanging a
word; and Clotald and his friends, after saluting the queen, left the
hall full of grief and pity. Isabella felt like an orphan whose parents
have just been buried, and dreaded lest her new mistress should make her
abandon the rule of life in which she had been brought up.</p>
<p>Two days afterwards, Richard put to sea, distracted among many other
sources of incertitude by two reflections‚Äîone was that he had to
perform exploits by which he might merit Isabella's hand; and the other,
that he could perform none without violating his conscience as a
catholic, which forbade him to draw his sword against those of his own
faith, but unless he did so, he should be denounced as a catholic or as
a coward, to the peril of his life and his hopes. But, in fine, he
determined to postpone his inclinations as a lover to his duty as a
catholic, and in his heart he prayed heaven to send him occasions in
which he might show himself at once valiant and a true Christian,‚Äîmight
satisfy his queen and merit Isabella.</p>
<p>For six days the two vessels sailed with a prosperous wind, shaping
their course for the Western Islands, for, in that direction they could
not fail to fall in with Portuguese East India men, or vessels returning
from the West Indies; but on the seventh day the wind became contrary
and continued that way so long that they could not make the islands, but
were forced to run for the coast of Spain. On nearing it at the entrance
of the straits of Gibraltar, they discovered three vessels, one very
large and two small. Richard steered towards his commander's ship to
know if it was his intention they should attack the three vessels just
discovered; but on nearing it, he saw them hoist a black flag, and
presently he heard a mournful sound of trumpets, indicating that either
the general or one of his chief officers was dead. When he came within
hail, which had not before been the case since they put to sea, there
was a call from the leading ship for Captain Richard to come on board,
as their general had died of apoplexy the preceding night. Sad as this
news was, Richard could not help being glad, not of his admiral's death,
but at finding himself in command of both ships, according to the
Queen's orders for the contingency which had occurred. He went on board
the flag-ship where he found some lamenting the old commander, and some
rejoicing over the new one; but all promised him obedience, yet
proclaimed him general with short ceremony, not having time for longer,
for two out of the three vessels they had discovered had quitted the
third and were bearing down upon them.</p>
<p>They at once made them out by the crescents on their flags to be Turkish
galleys, to the great delight of Richard, who believed that with the
help of Heaven he should make an important capture without prejudice to
his religion. The two galleys came up to reconnoitre the English ships,
which had not shown their national colours but those of Spain, in order
to baffle those who might overhaul them, and prevent their recognising
them as war cruisers. The Turks mistook them for trading vessels from
India, and made sure of capturing them with ease. Richard took care to
let them approach till they were well within range of his guns, which he
let fly at them so opportunely, that with a single broadside he disabled
one of the galleys, sending five balls through her middle and nearly
cutting her in two. She immediately heeled over and began to founder;
the other galley made haste to take her in tow, in order to get her
under the lee of the large ship; but Richard, whose ships manoeuvred as
rapidly as if they were impelled by oars, having reloaded his guns,
pursued the retreating galleys, pouring upon them an incessant shower of
balls. The crew of the crippled galley having clambered on board the
large ship, Richard poured such a cross fire from his two ships on her
consort, that she could neither use sails nor oars, and the Turks on
board her, following the example of their comrades, took refuge in the
large ship, not with the intention of defending her, but for the
momentary safety of their lives. The Christian galley-slaves broke their
chains, and mingling with the Turks also boarded the large ship, but as
they were in danger from the musquetry of Richard's two ships as they
were swarming up the side, he gave orders to cease firing on Turks and
Christians alike. The former, however, had already lost the great part
of their numbers, and the rest were cut to pieces with their own weapons
by the revolted slaves, who, thinking the two English ships were
Spanish, did marvels for the recovery of their freedom.</p>
<p>At last, when nearly all the Turks were killed, some Spaniards shouted
from the deck to their supposed countrymen to come on board and enjoy
the fruits of their victory. Richard asked them in Spanish what ship was
that? They replied that she was a Portuguese ship from the West Indies,
freighted with spices, and with such a quantity of diamonds and pearls
that she was worth a million. She had been driven into those latitudes
by a storm, much damaged, with all her guns thrown overboard, and her
crew almost perishing of hunger and thirst. In that condition, being
unable to make any resistance, she had been captured the day before by
these two galleys, which belonged to the corsair Arnaut Mami,<a id="FNanchor_79_79"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-11.htm.html#Footnote_79_79" class="pginternal"><sup>[79]</sup></a> and
which not having stowage room for her great cargo, had taken her in tow
to convey her to the river Larache. Richard apprised them, in return,
that if they supposed his two vessels were Spanish, they were greatly
mistaken, for they belonged to the Queen of England. This information
astonished and alarmed them, making them fear that they had escaped from
one rock to founder on another; but Richard told them they had nothing
to fear, and that they might rely on obtaining their liberty, provided
they did not make any defence. "It would be impossible for us to do so,"
they said, "for as we have told you, we have neither cannon nor other
arms, and have no choice but to throw ourselves upon the generosity of
your general. Since he has freed us from the intolerable yoke of the
Turks, let him enhance his good work by an act which will exalt his fame
all over the world wherever the news reaches of this memorable victory
and his magnanimity."</p>
<p>Richard lent a favourable ear to this request, and immediately called a
council of his officers to consider what might be the best means of
sending all the Christians to Spain, without incurring any risk from
them, should their numbers encourage them to rise and attempt to
overpower his crews. There were some who suggested that they should be
brought on board one by one, and put to death as they entered. "No,"
said Richard; "since by God's grace we have obtained so rich a prize, I
will not betray my ingratitude by such an act of cruelty. It is never
well to have recourse to the sword, when, with a little forethought, the
end may be secured by other means. I will, therefore, not have any
Catholic Christian put to death, not that I care so much for them, but
for my own sake and for yours, for I would not have the honour of our
victory tarnished by cruelty. My orders are, then, that the crew of one
of our ships, with all her guns and arms and the greater part of her
stores, be put on board the large Portuguese vessel, which we will then
take to England, and leave the Spaniards to return home on ours."</p>
<p>No one ventured to contravene this proposal, which to some appeared
equally magnanimous and judicious, while others in their hearts
condemned it as showing an undue leaning towards the Catholics.</p>
<p>Taking with him fifty arquebusiers Richard went on hoard the Portuguese
ship, in which he found about three hundred persons, who had escaped out
of the galleys. He immediately had the vessel he intended to discharge
brought alongside, and had its guns brought on board. Then making a
short speech to the Christians, he ordered them to pass into the
discharged vessel, where they found stores enough for more than a month
and for a greater number of people; and as they embarked he gave each of
them four Spanish crowns, which he sent for to his own ship, in order
partly to relieve their wants when they reached land, which was not far
off; for the lofty mountains of Abyla and Calpe were in sight. They all
thanked him heartily for his generous behaviour, and when they were
nearly all embarked, the same person who had first spoken to him from
the deck of the ship, addressed him, "You would do me a greater service,
valorous sir, in taking me with you to England than in sending me to
Spain; for, though it is my country, and it is but six days since I left
it, I have nothing to look for there but grief and desolation.</p>
<p>"You must know, se√±or, that at the sack of Cadiz which happened about
fifteen years ago, I lost a daughter, whom the English carried away with
them to England, and with her I lost the comfort of my age and the light
of my eyes, which since she passed from their sight, have never seen
anything to gladden them. Grief for this calamity and for the loss of
my property, of which I was also despoiled, so overcame me that I was no
longer able or willing to apply myself to commerce, in which I had been
so successful that I was commonly reputed to be the richest merchant in
our whole city; and so indeed I was, for, besides my credit, which was
good for many hundred thousand dollars, my estate was worth more than
fifty thousand ducats. I lost all; yet all my losses would have been
nothing had I not lost my daughter. After the general calamity and my
own, want pressed me so hard, that not being able to bear up against it,
myself and my wife‚Äîthat woe-begone creature sitting yonder‚Äîdetermined
to emigrate to the Indies, the common refuge of the well-born poor. We
embarked six days ago in a packet-ship, but just outside the harbour of
Cadiz we were captured by those two corsairs. This was a new addition to
our affliction; but it would have been greater had not the corsair taken
this Portuguese ship, which fortunately detained them until you came to
our rescue."</p>
<p>In reply to Richard's question what was his daughter's name, the
Spaniard said it was Isabella. This confirmed the suspicion which
Richard had all along entertained, that the person before him was the
father of his beloved mistress. Keeping this fact to himself, he told
the Spaniard that he would willingly take him and his wife to London,
where possibly they might obtain some intelligence about their child.</p>
<p>Taking them both on board his flag-ship, and having sufficiently armed
and manned the Portuguese galleon, he set sail that night, avoiding the
coast of Spain as much as possible, lest he should be intercepted in
consequence of! information given by the liberated captives. Among the
latter there were some twenty Turks, to whom also Richard granted
freedom, to show that his conduct had been the result simply of his
generous disposition, and not of any secret leaning to the Catholics:
and he asked the Spaniards to set the Turks at liberty upon the first
opportunity. The wind, which had blown fresh and fair at first, died
away into a calm, to the dismay of the English, who murmured against
Richard's unseasonable generosity, saying, that the liberated captives
might give information of what had happened, and that if there chanced
to be armed galleons in port, they might sally out and intercept them.</p>
<p>Richard knew that this was quite true, but strove to allay their fears
in the best way he could. But what availed with them more than all his
arguments, was that the wind sprang up again, so that they crowded all
sail, and in nine days reached London, from which they had been only a
month absent on their cruise. Richard would not enter the port with only
joyous demonstrations, on account of the death of his late commander,
but mingled signs of grief with them. At one moment bugles rang out
cheerily, at the next they were answered by melancholy trumpet notes,
and the wailing fife was heard at intervals between the lively rattle of
the drum and the clash of arms. From one mast-head hung a Turkish banner
reversed, and from another a long black streamer, the ends of which
dipped in the water. In this manner he entered the river of London in
his English ship, leaving the Portuguese ship at sea, for want of depth
of water in the river to float it.</p>
<p>These conflicting demonstrations puzzled the vast multitudes, who
observed them from the shore. They easily recognised the smaller vessel
as the flag-ship of Baron Lansac; but they could not make out how it was
that his second vessel had been exchanged for the large and powerful
ship which lay out at sea. But the problem was solved when they saw the
valorous Richard jump into his boat, fully equipped in rich and splendid
armour. Without waiting for any other escort than that of a vast
multitude of the people who followed him, he proceeded on foot to the
palace, where the queen was standing in a balcony, waiting for news of
the ships, and surrounded by her ladies, among whom was Isabella,
dressed in the English style, which became her as well as the Castilian.
A messenger, who had anticipated Richard's arrival, had startled her by
the announcement of his coming, and she stood watching for him with
feelings that fluttered between hope and fear, not knowing whether he
had sped well or ill upon his expedition.</p>
<p>Richard was a young man of noble presence, tall and finely proportioned,
and he looked to great advantage in a complete suit of Milanese armour
all graven and gilded, and instead of a helmet, a wide-leafed fawn
coloured hat with Walloon plumes. Thus equipped, and with his spirited
bearing, to some he seemed like Mars the god of battles; others, struck
by the beauty of his face, compared him to Venus sportively disguised in
the armour of that god. When he came before the Queen he knelt, and gave
a brief account of his expedition.</p>
<p>"After the sudden death of general de Lansac," he said, "I took his
place in pursuance of your Majesty's gracious orders. Shortly afterwards
we discovered two Turkish galleys towing a large ship, which we have
brought home with us. We attacked them; your Majesty's soldiers fought
with great spirit, as they always do, and the corsair galleys went to
the bottom. I liberated in your Majesty's royal name the Christians who
had escaped out of the hands of the Turks, and sent them away in one of
our vessels; and have only brought with me one Spaniard and his wife,
who desired of their own accord to come and behold your Majesty's
greatness. The great ship we took, is one of those which come from the
Portuguese possessions in India; being damaged by a storm, it fell into
the power of the Turks, who took it without any difficulty. According to
the account given by some of the Portuguese on board the ship, her cargo
of spices, and the pearls and diamonds she carries, are worth more than
a million. All is untouched, the Turks not having had time to lay hands
on anything, and I have given orders that the whole should be presented
to your Majesty. There is one jewel alone which, if your Majesty will
bestow it upon me, will leave me your debtor for ten other ships. That
jewel your Majesty has promised me: it is my Isabella, in obtaining whom
I shall be richly rewarded, not only for this service, such as it is,
which I have rendered your Majesty, but for many others which I intend
to perform in order to repay some part of the incalculable amount which
your Majesty will bestow upon me in that jewel."</p>
<p>"Rise, Richard," replied the queen, "and believe me that were I to
deliver Isabella to you in the way of bargain at the price at which I
value her, you could not pay for her with all the wealth of your
prize-ship, nor with what remains in the Indies. I give her to you
because I promised to do so, and because she is worthy of you, and you
of her; your valour alone entitles you to have her. If you have kept the
jewels in the ship for me, I have kept your jewel for you; and though
it may seem to you that I do not do much for you in returning to you
what is your own, I know that I confer upon you a boon the worth of
which is beyond all human computation. Isabella is yours; there she
stands; you may claim her when you will, and I believe that it will be
with her own consent, for she has the good sense to prize your affection
as it deserves. I shall expect you again to-morrow to give me a more
detailed account of your exploits, and bring me those two Spaniards who
wish to see me, that I may gratify their desire." Richard kissed the
queen's hand, and her majesty retired.</p>
<p>The ladies now gathered round Richard, and one of them, the lady Tansi,
who had taken a great liking to Isabella, and who was the liveliest and
most facetious lady of the court, said to him, "What is all this, sir?
Why these arms? Did you, perchance, imagine that you were coming here to
fight your enemies? Believe me, you have none but friends here, unless
it be the lady Isabella, who, as a Spaniard, is bound to bear you no
good will."</p>
<p>"Let her only vouchsafe, Lady Tansi, to have me a little in her
thoughts, and I am sure she will not think of me with ill will; for
ingratitude can have no place in the heart of one so good, so wise, and
so exquisitely fair."</p>
<p>"Since I am to be yours, se√±or Richard," said Isabella, "claim from me
what you will in recompense for the praises you bestow upon me."</p>
<p>Whilst Isabella and the other ladies were thus conversing with Richard,
there was a little girl present who did nothing but gaze at him, lift up
his cuishes to see what was beneath them, touch his sword, and, with
childlike simplicity, peep at her own image reflected in his bright
armour. When Richard was gone away, she said, turning to the ladies,
"Now I see what a fine thing war must be, since armed men look to such
advantage even among ladies." "Look to advantage!" exclaimed Lady Tansi;
"one might take Richard for the sun, come down from Heaven, to walk the
streets in that garb." Every one laughed at the little girl's remark,
and at Lady Tansi's hyperbole; and there lacked not back-biters, who
thought his appearing in arms at the palace was an act of great
impropriety; but others excused him, saying that it was a very natural
and pardonable act of vanity on the part of a gallant young soldier.</p>
<p>Richard was most cordially welcomed by his parents, relations, and
friends, and that night there were general rejoicings in London. On his
return home, he found Isabella's parents already there, and told his
father and mother who they were, but begged they would give no hint of
the matter to Isabella till he should make it known to her himself. His
desire was punctually observed. That night they began with a great
number of boats and barges, and in presence of a multitude of admiring
spectators, to unload the great galleon, but eight days were consumed in
the work before they had disembowelled it of its aromatic and precious
freight. On the following day, Richard went again to the palace, taking
with him Isabella's father and mother, dressed in the English style,
telling them that the queen wished to see them. They found the queen
surrounded by her ladies, with Isabella by her side, wearing, by the
queen's desire, for Richard's special gratification, the same dress in
which she had made her first appearance at court. Isabella's parents
were filled with admiration and astonishment at such a display of
grandeur and gaiety combined. They looked at Isabella, but did not
recognise her, though their hearts, prophetic of the happiness so near
at hand, began to throb, not anxiously, but with an emotion of joy for
which they could not account.</p>
<p>The queen would not allow Richard to kneel before her, but made him rise
and be seated on a chair which was placed for him alone, an unusual
favour, which provoked many envious comments. "It is not on a chair he
sits," said one, "but on the pepper he has brought." "It is a true
saying," remarked another, "that gifts can soften rocks, since they have
mollified the hard heart of our queen." "He sits at his ease," said a
third, "but there are those who will make bold to push him from his
seat." In fact, that new mark of honour which the queen bestowed on
Richard gave occasion to many to regard him with envy and malice; for
there is no favour which the sovereign bestows on a subject but pierces
the heart of the envious like a lance. In obedience to the queen's
command, Richard narrated more minutely the details of his conflict with
the corsairs, attributing the victory to God, and to the arms of her
valiant soldiers. He extolled them all collectively, and made special
mention of some who had particularly distinguished themselves, in order
that the queen might reward them all and singly. When he came to speak
of his having, in her majesty's name, set the Turks and Christians at
liberty, he said, pointing to Isabella's parents, "These are the persons
of whom I spoke yesterday to your majesty, who, desiring to behold your
greatness, earnestly besought me to bring them away with me. They are
from Cadiz, and from what they have told me, and from what I have myself
observed, I am assured that they are persons of worth and quality."</p>
<p>The queen commanded them to approach her. Isabella raised her eyes to
look at persons who she heard were Spaniards, and, above all, from
Cadiz, longing to know if perchance they were acquainted with her
parents. Her mother first encountered her gaze, and as she looked
attentively at her, there rose on her mind some shadowy confused
reminiscences that seemed to intimate she had seen that face before. Her
father was in the same wavering state of mind, not daring to believe the
evidence of his eyes, whilst Richard watched intently the workings of
their perplexed and dubious souls. The queen too noticed the emotion of
the two strangers, and also Isabella's uneasiness, for she saw her often
raise her hand to her forehead, which was bedewed with perspiration.
Whilst Isabella was longing that the person she imagined to be her
mother would speak, thinking that the sound of her voice would resolve
her doubts, the queen commanded her to ask the strangers in Spanish what
had induced them voluntarily to forego the freedom which Richard had
offered them, since freedom was the thing most prized, not only by
reasonable creatures, but even by irrational animals. Isabella put this
question to her mother, who, without answering a word, rushed abruptly
and almost totteringly to Isabella, and forgetting all respect of place
or circumstances, put her hand to her daughter's right ear, and
discovered a dark mole behind it. Assured now beyond all doubt that
Isabella was her daughter, she cried out, "Child of my heart! treasure
of my soul!" and swooned in her arms. The father, no less tender hearted
but with more self-command, gave no other token of his feelings than the
tears that streamed down his venerable face and beard. With her lips
pressed upon her mother's, Isabella bent her eyes upon her father, with
looks that spoke the gladness of her soul.</p>
<p>The queen was greatly affected by this touching scene, and said to
Richard, "I know not whether you have done wisely in contriving this
meeting, for sudden joy, it is known, can kill as well as grief." Then,
turning to Isabella, she withdrew her from her mother, who, after her
face had been sprinkled with water, came to her senses, and recollecting
herself a little better, fell on her knees before the queen, entreating
her majesty's pardon. Elizabeth graciously replied, and commanded that
the two strangers should take up their abode in the palace, that they
might have the more opportunity of rejoicing in their daughter's
society. Richard then renewed his request that the queen would fulfil
her promise, and bestow Isabella upon him, if so it were that he had
deserved her, but if not, he begged to be sent where he might find
opportunities of doing so.</p>
<p>The queen was well aware that Richard was well satisfied with himself,
and that there was no need of putting him to further proof; she told
him, therefore, that in four days he should obtain the object of his
desires, and that she would honour their union with her royal
countenance. Richard then took his leave of her majesty, his heart
swelling with joy at the near prospect of Isabella becoming his own for
ever. Time sped, but not with the nimbleness he desired; for those who
live on the hopes of pleasure to come, always imagine that time does not
fly, but hobbles on the feet of sloth itself. At last the day came on
which Richard expected, not to end his desires, but to find in Isabella
new graces which should make him love her more, if more was possible.
But in that brief space of time, in which he thought the bark of his
fortunes was running with a prosperous gale towards the desired haven,
it encountered such a fearful tempest, as a thousand times threatened it
with wreck.</p>
<p>The queen's keeper of the robes, who had charge of Isabella, had a son
aged two-and-twenty, named Count Ernest, whom his great wealth, his high
blood, and his mother's great favour with the queen, made too arrogant
and overbearing. He fell most violently in love with Isabella, and,
during Richard's absence, he had made some overtures to her which she
had coldly disregarded. Although repugnance and disdain manifested at
the outset usually make the enamoured desist from their suit, yet
Isabella's notorious disdain had the contrary effect on Ernest, for it
fired his passion, and consumed his sense of honour. He was almost
distracted when he found that the queen had adjudged Isabella to
Richard, and that she was so soon to become his; but before he committed
himself to the infamous and dastardly course which he ultimately
adopted, he first besought his mother to use her influence with the
queen on his behalf, declaring that his death was at hand unless he
obtained Isabella for his wife.</p>
<p>The countess, well knowing her son's violent and arrogant disposition,
and the obstinacy with which he pursued his desires, had reason to fear
that his passion would lead to some unhappy result. With a mother's
natural anxiety to gratify her son's wishes, she promised to speak to
the queen, not with the hope of succeeding in the impossible attempt to
make her majesty break her word, but in order not to sit down in
despair, while any remedy remained to be tried. That morning Isabella
was dressed by the queen's orders with a magnificence which defies
description. With her own hands her majesty put on her neck a string of
the largest pearls found in the galleon, valued at twenty thousand
ducats, and a diamond ring on her finger worth six thousand crowns. But
whilst the ladies were in great glee anticipating the glad time so near
at hand, the keeper of the robes presented herself before the queen, and
implored her on her knees to postpone Isabella's wedding for two days
longer, declaring that if her majesty would only do so, it would more
than reward her for all her past services. The queen desired to know, in
the first instance, why she made that request, so directly at variance
with the royal promise given to Richard; but the countess would not
explain until the queen, urged by curiosity to discover the cause of
this strange request, promised that she would grant it. Having thus
succeeded in her immediate object, the lady keeper made the queen
acquainted with her son's passion, and how, fearing that unless he
obtained Isabella he would commit some desperate deed against himself or
others, she had asked for that delay of two days in order that her
majesty might devise the best means of saving the life of her son. The
queen replied that had she not pledged her royal word, she would have
found a way to smooth over that difficulty, but that, for no
consideration, could she retract her promise or defraud Richard of the
hope she had given him.</p>
<p>The lady keeper reported the queen's answer to her son, but nothing
could overcome his headstrong presumption. Arming himself at all points
he mounted a powerful charger, and presented himself before Clotald's
house, and shouted for Richard to come to the window. Richard was
dressed as a bridegroom, and was on the point of setting out for the
palace with his friends, but hearing himself thus summoned, he went with
some surprise and showed himself at an open window. "Hark you, Richard;
I have something to say to you," said Count Ernest. "Our lady the queen
ordered you to go forth on her service and perform exploits that should
render you worthy of the peerless Isabella. You set out, and returned
with ships laden with wealth, with which you think you have bought your
title to Isabella. But though our lady the queen promised her to you, it
was under the belief that there was no one at her court who could serve
her better than you, or more justly aspire to the fair Spaniard's hand;
but in this it may be that her majesty was mistaken. Being of that
opinion, and holding it for very truth, I say that you have done no such
deeds as can make you worthy of Isabella, nor can you ever perform any
to raise you to that honour; and if you dare to maintain the contrary, I
defy you to the death."</p>
<p>"I am in no wise called upon to take up your defial," replied Richard;
"because I confess not only that I do not merit Isabella, but that no
man living does so. Confessing, therefore, the truth of what you allege,
I say again, that your defial touches not me; nevertheless, I accept it
in order to chastise your insolence." So saying, he left the window and
called for his arms.</p>
<p>Richard's family and the friends who had assembled to escort him to the
palace were thrown into confusion by this untoward incident. The
challenge having been so publicly given, it could not be but that some
one should report it to the queen. This was done accordingly, and her
majesty ordered the captain of her guard to arrest Count Ernest. The
captain made such good speed that he arrived just as Richard was riding
out from his father's house, mounted on a handsome steed, and equipped
with the magnificent arms in which he had gone to pay his respects to
the queen on his return from his expedition. The moment the count saw
the captain of the queen's guard, he guessed his purpose, and resolving
not to let himself be caught, he shouted out, "You see, Richard, how we
are interrupted. If you are bent upon chastising me, you will look for
me as I will look for you. Two people surely meet when they have a
mind." "The sooner the better," said Richard. Meanwhile, the captain of
the guards came up and, in the queen's name, arrested the count, who
surrendered, requesting to be taken into the queen's presence. The
captain complied, and carried Ernest before the queen, who, without
entering into any discourse with him, ordered that he should surrender
his sword and be committed to the Tower.</p>
<p>All these things were torture to the heart of Isabella and to her
parents, who saw their new-found happiness so soon disturbed. The lady
keeper advised the queen that to prevent the mischief which might break
out between her own family and Richard's, the possible cause of it
should be withdrawn, by sending Isabella to Spain. In support of this
suggestion she added that Isabella was a Catholic, and so rooted in that
faith, that all the arguments and persuasions she had used to withdraw
her from it, and they were many, were of no avail. The queen replied
that she esteemed her the more, since she was steadfast to the law
taught her by her parents; and that as for sending her to Spain, it was
not to be thought of, for she was charmed with her lovely presence and
her many graces and virtues. In fine, the queen was resolved that
Isabella should become Richard's wife, if not that day, on another,
without fail. The lady keeper was so mortified by this reply that she
withdrew without saying a word; and having already made up her mind that
unless Isabella was removed there could be no hope of relief for her son
or of peace between him and Richard, she determined to commit one of the
most atrocious acts that could enter the mind of a lady of her exalted
station.</p>
<p>Women being, for the most part, rash and sudden in the execution of
their resolves, the lady keeper that evening gave Isabella poison in a
conserve which she pressed her to take, under the pretence that it was
good for the sinking and oppression of the heart which she complained
of. A short while after Isabella had swallowed it her throat and tongue
began to swell, her lips turned black, her voice became hoarse, her eyes
fixed and glassy, and her breathing laboured and stertorous: in short,
she exhibited all the symptoms of having been poisoned. The queen's
ladies hastened to inform her majesty, assuring her that the lady keeper
had been the author of the nefarious deed.</p>
<p>The queen had no great difficulty in coming to the same conclusion, and
went at once to see Isabella, who seemed to be almost at the last gasp.
Sending with all speed for her physicians, she, meanwhile, ordered that
the sufferer should be given a quantity of powdered unicorn's horn and
several other antidotes, with which great princes are usually provided
against such casualties. The physicians arrived and begged the queen to
make the lady keeper declare what kind of poison she had used (for no
one doubted that she was the poisoner). This information having been
obtained from the criminal, the physician applied the proper remedies
with such good effect that, with God's help, Isabella's life was saved,
or at least there was a hope that it would be so.</p>
<p>The queen ordered that the lady keeper should be arrested and confined
in a chamber of the palace, intending to punish her as her crime
deserved; whilst the guilty woman thought to excuse herself by saying
that in killing Isabella she offered an acceptable sacrifice to heaven
by ridding the world of a Catholic, and removing with her the cause of
affliction to her son. Finally, Isabella did not die; but she escaped
only with the loss of her hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes, her face
swollen, her bloom gone, her skin blotched and blistered, and her eyes
red and humid. In a word, she was now become an object as loathsome to
look at as she had before been surpassingly beautiful. The change was so
frightful that those who knew her thought it would have been better had
the poison killed her. But notwithstanding all this, Richard supplicated
the queen to let him take her home with him, for the great love he bore
her comprehended not only her body but her soul, and if Isabella had
lost her beauty, she could not have lost her infinite virtues. "Be it
so," said the queen. "Take her, Richard, and reckon that you take in her
a most precious jewel, in a rough wooden casket. God knows how gladly I
would give her to you as I received her; but since that is impossible,
perhaps the punishment I will inflict on the perpetrator of the crime
will be some satisfaction to your feelings."</p>
<p>Richard spoke earnestly in the culprit's behalf, and besought her
majesty to pardon her. Finally, Isabella and her parents were consigned
to his care, and he took them home to his father's house, the queen
having added to the fine pearls and the diamonds she had bestowed on
Isabella other jewels and rich dresses, such as manifested the great
affection she felt for her. Isabella remained for two months in the same
state, without the least sign appearing that her beauty would ever
return; but at the end of that time her skin began to peel off, and she
gradually recovered the natural bloom of her lovely complexion.
Meanwhile, Richard's parents, thinking it impossible that Isabella
should ever again be what she had been, determined to send for the
Scotch lady, to whom they had at first intended to unite him. They did
not doubt that the actual beauty of the new bride would make their son
forget the lost beauty of her rival, whom they intended to send to Spain
with her parents, giving them so much wealth as would compensate them
for their past losses. All this was settled between them without
Richard's knowledge, and soon after the new bride entered their doors,
duly accompanied, and so beautiful that none could compare with her in
London, now that Isabella's charms were gone.</p>
<p>Richard was astounded at this unexpected arrival, and fearing that it
would have a fatal effect upon Isabella, he went to her bedside, and
said to her, in presence of her parents, "Beloved of my soul, my
parents, in their great love for me, but ill conceiving how great is
mine for you, have brought hither a Scotch lady, to whom they arranged
to marry me before I knew your worth. They have done so, I believe, upon
the supposition that her great beauty will efface from my soul the image
of yours, which is deeply impressed upon it. But from the moment I first
loved you, Isabella, it was with a different love from that which finds
its end attained in the gratification of the sensual appetite: for
though your great beauty captivated my senses, your infinite virtues
enthralled my soul, so that if I loved you in your beauty, I adore you
in your plainness. That I may confirm that truth, put your hand in
mine."</p>
<p>She held out her right hand; he took it in his, and continued:</p>
<p>"By the Catholic faith which my Christian parents have taught me; or, if
that is not as pure and perfect as it ought, then, by that held by the
Roman pontiff, and which in my heart I confess, believe, and hold, do I
swear, and by the true God who hears us, I promise you, Isabella, soul
of my soul! to be your husband; and your husband I am from this moment,
if you will raise me up so high."</p>
<p>Isabella could only kiss Richard's hand again and again, and tell him in
a voice broken by her tears, that she accepted him as hers, and gave
herself to him as his slave. Richard kissed her disfigured face, which
he had never ventured to kiss in its beauty; and her parents, with tears
of affection, ratified their solemn betrothal. Richard told them that he
would find a way to postpone his marriage with the Scotch lady, and that
when his father proposed to send them to Spain they were not to refuse,
but were to go to Cadiz and wait for him there or in Seville for two
years, within which time he gave them his word he would be with them, if
God spared his life. Should he not appear within that time, they might
be assured that he was prevented by some insuperable impediment, and
most probably by death. Isabella replied that she would wait for him not
only two years, but all the years of her life, until she knew that he
was no longer alive; for the moment that brought her that news would be
her last.</p>
<p>Richard having at length quitted Isabella, went and told his parents
that on no account would he marry the Scotch lady until he had first
been to Rome for the satisfaction of his conscience; and he represented
the matter in such a light to them and to the relations of Clesterna
(that was the name of the Scotch lady), that as they were all Catholics,
they easily assented, and Clesterna was content to remain in her
father-in-law's house until the return of Richard, who proposed to be
away a year. This being settled, Clotald told his son of his intention
to send Isabella and her parents to Spain, if the queen gave them leave;
perhaps her native air would confirm and expedite her incipient
recovery. Richard, to avoid betraying his secret intentions, desired
his father, with seeming indifference, to do as he thought best; only he
begged him not to take away from Isabella any of the presents which the
queen had given her. Clotald promised this, and the same day he went and
asked the queen's leave both to marry his son to Clesterna, and to send
Isabella and her parents to Spain. The queen granted both requests, and
without having recourse to lawyers or judges, she forthwith passed
sentence on the lady keeper, condemning her to lose her office, and to
pay down ten thousand crowns for Isabella. As for Count Ernest, she
banished him from England for six years.</p>
<p>Four days afterwards Richard set out on his exile, and the money had
been already paid. The queen, sending for a rich merchant, resident in
London, who was a Frenchman, and had correspondents in France, Italy,
and Spain, put the ten thousand crowns into his hands, and desired him
to let Isabella's father have bills for the amount on Seville or some
other place in Spain. The merchant having deducted his profit, told the
queen he would give good and safe bills on another French merchant, his
correspondent in Seville, in the following manner:‚ÄîHe would write to
Paris that the bills might be drawn there by another correspondent of
his, in order that they should be dated from France and not from
England, because of the interdicted communication between that country
and Spain. It would only be necessary to have a letter of advice from
him, with his signature and without date, in sight of which the merchant
of Seville would immediately pay the money, according to previous advice
from the merchant of Paris.</p>
<p>In fine, the queen took such securities from the merchant as made the
payment certain; and not content with this, she sent for the master of a
Flemish vessel who was about to sail for France, only to obtain a
manifest from some French port, in order to be allowed to land in Spain;
and she begged him to take Isabella and her parents, treat them well,
and land them safely at the first Spanish port he reached. The master,
who desired to please the queen, said he would do so, and would land
them at Lisbon, Cadiz, or Seville. After this the queen sent word to
Clotald not to take from Isabella any of the presents she had given her,
whether jewels or clothes.</p>
<p>The next day Isabella and her parents came to take leave of the queen,
who received them with great affection. The queen gave them the
merchant's bills, besides many other presents, both in money and in
things suitable for their voyage. Isabella expressed her gratitude in
such terms as to increase the queen's gracious disposition towards her.
She took leave of the ladies of the court, who, now that she had become
plain, would rather have had her remain among them, having no longer
reason to envy her beauty, and being willing to enjoy her society for
the sake of her good qualities of mind and disposition. The queen
embraced the three, and took leave of them, commending them to good
fortune and to the master of the vessel, and asking Isabella to inform
her of her arrival in Spain, and of her health at all times through the
French merchant. That evening they embarked, not without tears on the
part of Clotald, his wife, and his whole household, by whom Isabella was
exceedingly beloved. Richard was not present at the departure, for, in
order to avoid betraying his feelings, he had gone with some of his
friends to the chase.</p>
<p>Many were the dainties which the lady Catherine gave. Isabella for use
on the voyage; endless were her embraces, her tears, and her injunctions
that she should write to her; for all which Isabella and her parents
returned suitable thanks. That night the vessel set sail, and having
reached France with a fair wind, and obtained the necessary papers to
enable them to enter Spain, they crossed the bar of Cadiz thirty days
afterwards, and there Isabella and her parents disembarked. Being known
to the whole city, they were joyfully welcomed, and warmly congratulated
on their recovery of Isabella, and on their liberation, from their
Turkish captors (for that fact had been made known by the captives whom
Richard generously released), and also from detention in England. By
this time Isabella began to give great hopes that she would quite
recover her original beauty.</p>
<p>For more than a month they remained in Cadiz, recruiting themselves
after the toils of their voyage; and then they went to Seville, to see
if they should obtain payment of the ten thousand crowns upon the French
merchant's bill. Two days after their arrival they called upon the
person on whom it was drawn. He acknowledged it, but said that, until
the arrival of advices from Paris, he could not pay the money.
Isabella's father hired a large house facing St. Paul's, because there
was in that holy convent a nun who was remarkable for rare musical
talents, and who was his own niece. They chose the house to be near her
for that reason, and because Isabella had told Richard that if he came
to look for her he would find her in Seville, and her cousin, the nun of
St. Paula's, would tell him where: he had only to ask for the nun who
had the best voice in the convent; every one would know her by that
description.</p>
<p>It was forty days more before the advices came from Paris, and two days
after their arrival the French merchant paid Isabella the ten thousand
crowns, which she handed over to her parents. With that sum, and
something more made by the sale of part of Isabella's numerous jewels,
her father again began business as a merchant, to the surprise of those
who were cognisant of his great losses. After a few months his lost
credit began to return; so, too, did his daughter's good looks, so that,
whenever female beauty was the subject of discourse, the palm was
universally conceded to the Spanish-English lady; for by that name, as
well as for her great beauty, she was known throughout the city. Through
the French merchant of Seville, Isabella and her parents wrote to the
queen of England, announcing their arrival in such grateful and dutiful
terms as the many favours received at her Majesty's hands required. They
also wrote to Clotald and Catherine, whom Isabella addressed as her
revered parents.</p>
<p>Their letters to the queen remained unanswered, but from Clotald and his
wife they received a reply, congratulating them on their safe arrival,
and informing them that their son Richard had set out from France the
day after their departure, and thence to other countries, which it
behoved him to visit for the tranquillity of his conscience. Isabella
immediately concluded that Richard had left England for no other purpose
than to seek her; and cheered by this hope, she was as happy as she
could be, and strove to live in such a manner that, when Richard arrived
in Seville, the fame of her virtues should reach his ears before he
learned where she lived.</p>
<p>She seldom or never quitted the house, except to go to the convent, and
attended no other church services than those performed there. She never
went near the river, or to Triana, or witnessed the general rejoicings
at the Campo de Tablada, or the Puerta de Xeres on Sari Sebastian's day,
celebrated by an almost innumerable multitude; in short, she never went
abroad for any kind of amusement in Seville; her whole time was spent in
her devotions, and in praying and hoping for Richard's arrival. The
consequence of this strict retirement was a great increase of the
general interest about her; thence came serenades in her street by
night, and promenades by day. The desire which so many felt to see her,
and the difficulty of accomplishing it, was a great source of gain to
the professional go-betweens, who severally professed that they alone
had the ear of Isabella, and some there were who had recourse to what
are called charms, which are nothing but deceits and follies; but in
spite of all this, Isabella was like a rock in the ocean, which the
winds and waves assail in vain. A year and a half had now passed, and
her heart began to yearn more and more as the end of the period assigned
by Richard drew near. Already, in imagination, she looked upon him as
arrived; he stood before her eyes; she asked him what had caused his
long delay; she heard his excuses; she forgave him, embraced and
welcomed him as the half of her soul; and then there was put into her
hands a letter from the lady Catherine, dated from London fifty days
before. It was as follows:‚Äî</p>
<p>"Daughter of my heart,‚ÄîYou doubtless recollect Richard's page,
Guillart. He accompanied Richard on his journey the day after you
sailed, to France and other parts, whereof I informed you in a former
letter. This said Guillart, after we had been sixteen months without
hearing news of my son, yesterday entered our house with news that Count
Ernest had basely murdered Richard in France. Imagine, my daughter, the
effect upon his father, myself, and his intended wife, of such news as
this, coming to us in such wise as left no doubt of our misfortune. What
Clotald and myself beg of you once more, daughter of my soul, is that
you will pray heartily to God for the soul of Richard, for well he
deserves this service at your hands, he who loved you so much as you
know. Pray also to our Lord to grant us patience, and that we may make a
good end; as we will pray for long life for you and your parents."</p>
<p>This letter and the signature left no doubt in Isabella's mind of the
death of her husband. She knew the page Guillart very well, and knew
that he was a person of veracity, and that he could have had no motive
for publishing false news in such a matter; still less could the lady
Catharine have had any interest in deceiving her so painfully. In fine,
in whatever way she considered the subject, the conclusion at which she
invariably arrived was, that this dismal intelligence was unquestionably
true. When she had finished reading the letter, without shedding tears
or showing any outward tokens of grief, with a composed face and
apparently tranquil breast, she rose from her seat, entered an oratory,
and kneeling before a crucifix, made a vow to become a nun, thinking
herself free to do so, as she was no longer a betrothed maiden, but a
widow. Her parents studiously concealed the grief which this affecting
news caused them, in order that they might the better console their
bereaved daughter; whilst she, as if mistress over her sorrow, having
subdued it by the holy Christian resolution she had made, became their
comforter. She made her intention known to them, and they advised her to
postpone its execution, until the two years were elapsed which Richard
had assigned as the duration of his absence. That delay would suffice
for confirming the news of his death, and then she might with more
security change her condition. Isabella followed their advice; and the
six months and a half which remained to complete the term of two years
were spent by her in devotional exercises, and in arranging for her
entrance into the convent of Santa Paula, in which her cousin was a nun.</p>
<p>The remainder of the two years elapsed, and the day arrived when she was
to take the veil. The news having spread through the city, the convent,
and the space between it and Isabella's abode, was thronged by those who
knew her by sight, or by report only; and her father having invited her
friends, and these having invited others, Isabella had for her escort
one of the most imposing retinues ever seen in Seville on such
occasions. It included the chief justice of Seville, the vicar-general,
and all the titled personages of both sexes in the city, so great was
the desire of all to behold the sun of Isabella's beauty, which had been
for so many months eclipsed. And as it is customary for maidens about to
take the veil to dress themselves in their very gayest attire on the day
when they are to renounce for ever the pomps and vanities of the world,
Isabella wore the same splendid dress in which she was presented to the
queen of England, with her necklace and girdle of lustrous pearls, her
diamond ring, and all her other sumptuous jewels. Thus gorgeously
attired, Isabella set out from home on foot, for the short distance to
the convent seemed to render carriages superfluous; but the concourse
was so great that the procession could hardly advance, and its members
regretted too late that they had not chosen to ride instead of walking.
Some of the spectators blessed the father and mother of that lovely
creature; others praised Heaven that had endowed her with so much
beauty. Some strained forward to see her; others, having seen her once,
ran forward to have a second view of her. Among those who were most
eager to behold her, was a man who attracted the notice of many by his
extraordinary efforts. He was dressed in the garb of a slave lately
ransomed, and wore on his breast the emblem of the Holy Trinity, by
which it was known that he had been redeemed by the charity of the
Redemptorist fathers.</p>
<p>Already Isabella had set one foot on the threshold of the convent gate,
where the prioress and the nuns stood ready to receive her with the
cross, when this ransomed captive cried out, "Stop, Isabella, stop!"
Isabella and her parents turned at this cry, and saw the man cleaving
his way towards them through the crowd by main strength. The blue hat he
wore having fallen oft through the violence of his exertions, disclosed
a profusion of flaxen hair, and a clear red and white complexion, which
showed him at once to be a foreigner.</p>
<p>Struggling, stumbling, and rising again, he at last reached the spot
where Isabella stood, caught her hand in his, and said, "Do you know me,
Isabella? I am Richard, your betrothed." "Well do I know you," said
Isabella, "if indeed you are not a phantom come to trouble my repose."
Her parents also examined his features attentively, and saw that this
captive was indeed Richard. As for him, weeping at Isabella's feet, he
implored her not to let the strange garb he wore prevent her recognising
him, nor his low fortune impede the fulfilment of the pledges exchanged
between them. In spite of the impression which the letter from Richard's
mother had made on her memory, Isabella chose rather to believe the
living evidence before her eyes; and embracing the captive, she said,
"Without doubt, my lord and master, you are he who alone could hinder
the fulfilment of my Christian determination; you are without doubt the
half of my soul; my own betrothed! your image is stamped upon my memory,
and treasured in my heart. The news of your death, sent me by your lady
mother, not having killed me on the spot, I resolved to dedicate myself
to religion, and I was just about to enter this convent for the rest of
my days; but since God has shown us by so just an impediment that he
wills otherwise, it is not for me to refuse obedience. Come, se√±or, to
the house of my parents, which is yours, and there I will give myself to
you in the way which our holy catholic faith prescribes."</p>
<p>This dialogue, overheard by the spectators, struck them all with
amazement. The chief justice and the vicar-general immediately demanded
what was all this ado, who was this stranger, and what marriage was this
they talked about. Isabella's father replied, that what they had seen
was the sequel of a story which required a different place for the
telling of it; therefore, he begged that all who desired to hear it
should turn back to his house, which was close by, and there he would
fully satisfy their curiosity, and fill them with wonder at the strange
things he should relate.</p>
<p>Just then one of the crowd cried out, "Se√±ors, this young man is the
great English corsair. It is not much more than two years since he took
from the Algerine corsairs the great Portuguese galleon from the Indies.
There is not the least doubt that he is the very man; I know him,
because he set me at liberty, and gave me money to carry me to Spain,
and not me only, but three hundred other captives likewise." These words
increased the general excitement and the desire to see all these
intricate matters cleared up. Finally, the principal persons of the
city, with the chief justice and the vicar-general, went back with
Isabella to her father's house, leaving the nuns sorely discomfited, and
crying with vexation at the loss they had sustained in not having the
beautiful Isabella to grace their nunnery. The company being arrived at
the house of Isabella's father, she made them be seated in a long hall,
and though Richard would willingly have taken it upon himself to tell
his story, yet he thought it better to trust it to Isabella's tongue
than to his own, which was not very expert in speaking Spanish.
Accordingly she began her narration in the midst of profound silence and
attention.</p>
<p>She related all that happened to her from the day when Clotald carried
her off from Cadiz until her return thither; also Richard's engagement
with the Turks; his liberality to the Christians; the promise they had
given each other to be husband and wife; the two years' delay agreed on,
and the news she had received of his death, which seemed to her so
certain, as to have nearly occasioned her taking the veil! She extolled
the liberality of the queen of England, the Christian faith of Richard
and his parents, and she concluded by saying, that Richard would relate
what had happened to him since he left London until that moment, when he
stood before them in the dress of a captive, and with the mark of having
been ransomed by charity. "I will do so," said Richard, "and briefly
relate the hardships I have undergone.</p>
<p>"I quitted London to avoid marrying Clisterna, the Scottish Catholic
lady, to whom Isabella has told you that my parents wished to unite me,
and I took with me Guillart, my page, the same who carried the news of
my death to London, as my mother stated in her letter. Passing through
France, I arrived in Rome, where my soul was gladdened, and my faith
fortified. I kissed the feet of the supreme pontiff, confessed my sins
to the grand penitentiary, obtained absolution, and received the
necessary certificates of my confession and penance, and of the
submission I had paid to our holy mother, the church. This done, I
visited the numberless holy places in that sacred city, and out of two
thousand crowns I had with me in gold, I deposited one thousand six
hundred with a money-changer, who gave me a letter of credit for them on
one Roqui, a Florentine, in this city. With the four hundred that
remained, I set out for Spain, by way of Genoa, where I had heard that
there were two galleys of that signory bound for this country. I arrived
with Guillart at a place called Aquapendente, which is the last town in
the pope's dominions on the road to Florence, and in an inn at which I
alighted, I met Count Ernest, my mortal enemy. He had four servants with
him, he was disguised, and was going, as I understood, to Rome, not
because he was a Catholic, but from motives of curiosity. I thought he
had not recognised me, and shut myself up in a room with my servant
Guillart, where I remained on my guard, intending to shift my quarters
at nightfall. I did not do so, however, for the perfect indifference
shown by the count and his servants made me confident that they had not
recognised me. I supped in my room, locked the door, looked to my sword,
commended myself to God, but would not lie down.</p>
<p>"My servant lay asleep, and I sat on a chair between asleep and awake;
but a little after midnight, I was near put to sleep for eternity by
four pistol shots fired at me, as I afterwards learned, by the count and
his servants. They left me for dead, and their horses being in
readiness, they rode off, telling the innkeeper to bury me suitably, for
I was a man of quality. My servant, awaking in terror at the noise,
leaped out of a window, and ran away in such mortal fear, that it seems
he never stopped till he got to London, for it was he brought the news
of my death.</p>
