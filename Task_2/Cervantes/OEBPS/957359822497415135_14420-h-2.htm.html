<body class="x-ebookmaker x-ebookmaker-2"><p>But I had forgotten to say, that when Monipodio had first appeared, all
those who were waiting for him, made a deep and long reverence, the two
dashing cavaliers alone excepted, who did but just touch their hats, and
then continued their walk up and down the court.</p>
<p>Monipodio also began to pace up and down the patio, and, as he did so,
he questioned the new disciples as to their trade, their birthplace, and
their parents. To this Rincon replied, "Our trade is sufficiently
obvious, since we are here before your worship; as to our country, it
does not appear to me essential to the matter in hand that we should
declare it, any more than the names of our parents, since we are not now
stating our qualifications for admission into some noble order of
knighthood."</p>
<p>"What you say, my son, is true, as well as discreet," replied Monipodio;
"and it is, without doubt, highly prudent to conceal those
circumstances; for if things should turn out badly, there is no need to
have placed upon the books of register, and under the sign manual of the
justice-clerk, 'So and so, native of such a place, was hanged, or made
to dance at the whipping-post, on such a day,' with other announcements
of the like kind, which, to say the least of them, do not sound
agreeable in respectable ears. Thus, I repeat, that to conceal the name
and abode of your parents, and even to change your own proper
appellation, are prudent measures. Between ourselves there must,
nevertheless, be no concealment: for the present I will ask your names
only, but these you must give me."</p>
<p>Rincon then told his name, and so did Cortado: whereupon Monipodio said,
"Henceforward I request and desire that you, Rincon, call yourself
Rinconete, and you, Cortado, Cortadillo; these being names which accord,
as though made in a mould, with your age and circumstances, as well as
with our ordinances, which make it needful that we should also know the
names of the parents of our comrades, because it is our custom to have a
certain number of masses said every year for the souls of our dead, and
of the benefactors of our society; and we provide for the payment of the
priests who say them, by setting apart a share of our swag for that
purpose.</p>
<p>"These masses, thus said and paid for, are of great service to the souls
aforesaid. Among our benefactors we count the Alguazil, who gives us
warning; the Advocate, who defends us; the Executioner, who takes pity
upon us when we have to be whipped, and the man who, when we are running
along the street, and the people in full cry after us bawling 'Stop
thief,' throws himself between us and our pursuers, and checks the
torrent, saying, 'Let the poor wretch alone, his lot is hard enough; let
him go, and his crime will be his punishment.' We also count among our
benefactors the good wenches who aid us by their labours while we are in
prison, or at the galleys; our fathers, and the mothers who brought us
into the world; and, finally, we take care to include the Clerk of the
Court, for if he befriend us, there is no crime which he will not find
means to reduce to a slight fault, and no fault which he does not
prevent from being punished. For all these our brotherhood causes the
<i>sanctimonies</i> (ceremonies) I have named to be <i>solecised</i> (solemnised)
every year, with all possible <i>grandiloquence</i>.</p>
<p>"Certainly," replied Rinconete (now confirmed in that name), "certainly
that is a good work, and entirely worthy of the lofty and profound
genius with which we have heard that you, Señor Monipodio, are endowed.
Our parents still enjoy life; but should they precede us to the tomb,
we will instantly give notice of that circumstance to this happy and
highly esteemed fraternity, to the end that you may have 'sanctimonies
solecised' for their souls, as your worship is pleased to say, with the
customary 'grandiloquence.'"</p>
<p>"And so shall it be done," returned Monipodio, "if there be but a piece
of me left alive to look to it."</p>
<p>He then called their conductor, saying, "Hallo! there, Ganchuelo!<a id="FNanchor_23_23"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_23_23" class="pginternal"><sup>[23]</sup></a> Is
the watch set?" "Yes," replied the boy; "three sentinels are on guard,
and there is no fear of a surprise." "Let us return to business, then,"
said Monipodio. "I would fain know from you, my sons, what you are able
to do, that I may assign you an employment in conformity with your
inclinations and accomplishments."</p>
<p>"I," replied Rinconete, "know a trick or two to gammon a bumpkin; I am
not a bad hand at hiding what a pal has prigged; I have a good eye for a
gudgeon; I play well at most games of cards, and have all the best turns
of the pasteboard at my finger ends; I have cut my eye teeth, and am
about as easy to lay hold of as a hedgehog; I can creep through a
cat-hole or down a chimney, as I would enter the door of my father's
house; and will muster a million of tricks better than I could marshal a
regiment of soldiers; and flabbergast the knowingest cove a deal sooner
than pay back a loan of two reals."</p>
<p>"These are certainly the rudiments," admitted Monipodio, "but all such
things are no better than old lavender flowers, so completely worn out
of all savour that there is not a novice who may not boast of being a
master in them. They are good for nothing but to catch simpletons who
are stupid enough to run their heads against the church steeple; but
time will do much for you, and we must talk further together. On the
foundation already laid you shall have half a dozen lessons; and I then
trust in God that you will turn out a famous craftsman, and even,
mayhap, a master."</p>
<p>"My abilities shall always be at your service, and that of the gentlemen
who are our comrades," replied Rinconete; and Monipodio then turned
towards Cortadillo.</p>
<p>"And you, Cortadillo, what may you be good for?" he inquired; to which
Cortadillo replied, "For my part I know the trick called 'put in two,
and take out five,' and I can dive to the bottom of a pocket with great
precision and dexterity." "Do you know nothing more?" continued
Monipodio. "Alas, no, for my sins, that is all I can do," admitted
Cortadillo, "Do not afflict yourself, nevertheless," said the master;
"you are arrived at a good port, where you will not be drowned, and you
enter a school in which you can hardly fail to learn all that is
requisite for your future welfare. And now as to courage: how do you
feel yourselves provided in that respect, my children?" "How should we
be provided," returned Rinconete, "but well and amply? We have courage
enough to attempt whatever may be demanded in our art and profession."
"But I would have you to possess a share of that sort which would enable
you to suffer as well as to dare," replied Monipodio, "which would carry
you, if need were, through a good half dozen of <i>ansias</i> without opening
your lips, and without once saying 'This mouth is mine.'" "We already
know what the <i>ansias</i> are, Señor Monipodio," replied Cortadillo, "and
are prepared for all; since we are not so ignorant but that we know very
well, that what the tongue says, the throat must pay for; and great is
the grace heaven bestows on the bold man (not to give him a different
name), in making his life or death depend upon the discretion of his
tongue, as though there were more letters in a No than an Aye."</p>
<p>"Halt there, my son; you need say no more," exclaimed Monipodio at this
point of the discourse. "The words you have just uttered suffice to
convince, oblige, persuade, and constrain me at once to admit you both
to full brotherhood, and dispense with your passing through the year of
novitiate."</p>
<p>"I also am of that opinion," said one of the gaily-dressed Bravos; and
this was the unanimous feeling of the whole assembly. They therefore
requested that Monipodio would immediately grant the new brethren the
enjoyment of all the immunities of their confraternity, seeing that
their good mien and judicious discourse proved them to be entirely
deserving of that distinction.</p>
<p>Monipodio replied, that, to satisfy the wishes of all, he at once
conferred on those new-comers all the privileges desired, but he
exhorted the recipients to remember that they were to hold the favour in
high esteem, since it was a very great one: consisting in the exemption
from payment of the <i>media anata</i>, or tax levied on the first theft they
should commit, and rendering them free of all the inferior occupations
of their office for the entire year. They were not obliged, that is to
say, to bear messages to a brother of higher grade, whether in prison or
at his own residence. They were permitted to drink their wine without
water, and to make a feast when and where they pleased, without first
demanding permission of their principal. They were, furthermore, to
enter at once on a full share of whatever was brought in by the superior
brethren, as one of themselves—with many other privileges, which the
new comers accepted as most signal favours, and on the possession of
which they were felicitated by all present, in the most polite and
complimentary terms.</p>
<p>While these pleasing ceremonies were in course of being exchanged, a boy
ran in, panting for breath, and cried out, "The Alguazil of the
vagabonds is coming direct to the house, but he has none of the
Marshalsea men with him."</p>
<p>"Let no one disturb himself," said Monipodio. "This is a friend; never
does he come here for our injury. Calm your anxiety, and I will go out
to speak with him." At these words all resumed their self-possession,
for they had been considerably alarmed; and Monipodio went forth to the
door of his house, where he found the Alguazil, with whom he remained
some minutes in conversation, and then returned to the company. "Who was
on guard to-day," he asked, "in the market of San Salvador?" "I was,"
replied the conductor of our two friends, the estimable Ganchuelo.
"You!" replied Monipodio. "How then does it happen that you have not
given notice of an amber-coloured purse which has gone astray there this
morning, and has carried with it fifteen crowns in gold, two double
reals, and I know not how many quartos?"</p>
<p>"It is true," replied Ganchuelo, "that this purse has disappeared, but
it was not I took it, nor can I imagine who has done so." "Let there be
no tricks with me," exclaimed Monipodio; "the purse must be found, since
the Alguazil demands it, and he is a friend who finds means to do us a
thousand services in the course of the year." The youth again swore
that he knew nothing about it, while Monipodio's choler began to rise,
and in a moment flames seemed to dart from his eyes. "Let none of you
dare," he shouted, "to venture on infringing the most important rule of
our order, for he who does so shall pay for it with his life. Let the
purse be found, and if any one has been concealing it to avoid paying
the dues, let him now give it up. I will make good to him all that he
would have been entitled to, and out of my own pocket too; for, come
what may, the Alguazil must not be suffered to depart without
satisfaction." But Ganchuelo could do no more than repeat, with all
manner of oaths and imprecations, that he had neither taken the purse,
nor ever set eyes on it.</p>
<p>All this did but lay fuel on the flame of Monipodio's anger, and the
entire assembly partook of his emotions; the honourable members
perceiving that their statutes were violated, and their wise ordinances
infringed. Seeing, therefore, that the confusion and alarm had now got
to such a height, Rinconete began to think it time to allay it, and to
calm the anger of his superior, who was bursting with rage. He took
counsel for a moment with Cortadillo, and receiving his assent, drew
forth the purse of the Sacristan, saying:—</p>
<p>"Let all questions cease, gentlemen: here is the purse, from which
nothing is missing that the Alguazil has described, since my comrade
Cortadillo prigged it this very day, with a pocket-handkerchief into the
bargain, which he borrowed from the same owner." Thereupon Cortadillo
produced the handkerchief before the assembled company.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Monipodio exclaimed "Cortadillo the Good! for by that title
and surname shall you henceforward be distinguished. Keep the
handkerchief, and I take it upon myself to pay you duly for this
service; as to the purse, the Alguazil must carry it away just as it is,
for it belongs to a Sacristan who happens to be his relation, and we
must make good in his case the proverb, which says, 'To him who gives
thee the entire bird, thou canst well afford a drumstick of the same.'
This good Alguazil can save us from more mischief in one day than we can
do him good in a hundred."</p>
<p>All the brotherhood with one voice approved the spirit and gentlemanly
proceeding of the two new comers, as well as the judgment and decision
of their superior, who went out to restore the purse to the Alguazil.
As to Cortadillo, he was confirmed in his title of the <i>Good</i>, much as
if the matter had concerned a Don Alonzo Perez de Guzman, surnamed the
Good, who from the walls of Tarifa threw down to his enemy the dagger
that was to destroy the life of his only son.<a id="FNanchor_24_24"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_24_24" class="pginternal"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>
<p>When Monipodio returned to the assembly he was accompanied by two girls,
with rouged faces, lips reddened with carmine, and necks plastered with
white. They wore short camlet cloaks, and exhibited airs of the utmost
freedom and boldness. At the first glance Rinconete and Cortadillo could
see what was the profession of these women. They had no sooner entered,
than they hurried with open arms, the one to Chiquiznaque, the other to
Maniferro; these were the two bravos, one of whom bore the latter name
because he had an iron hand, in place of one of his own, which had been
cut off by the hand of justice. These two men embraced the girls with
great glee, and inquired if they had brought the wherewithal to moisten
their throats. "How could we think of neglecting that, old blade!"
replied one of the girls, who was called Gananciosa.<a id="FNanchor_25_25"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_25_25" class="pginternal"><sup>[25]</sup></a> "Silvatillo,
your scout, will be here before long with the clothes-basket, crammed
with whatever good luck has sent us."</p>
<p>And true it was; for an instant afterwards, a boy entered with a
clothes-basket covered with a sheet.</p>
<p>The whole company renewed their rejoicings on the arrival of Silvatillo,
and Monipodio instantly ordered that one of the mats should be brought
from the neighbouring chamber, and laid out in the centre of the court.
Furthermore he commanded that all the brotherhood should take places
around it, in order that while they were taking the wrinkles out of
their stomachs, they might talk about business.</p>
<p>To this proposal the old woman, who had been kneeling before the image,
replied, "Monipodio, my son, I am not in the humour to keep festival
this morning, for during the last two days I have had a giddiness and
pain in my head, that go near to make me mad; I must, besides, be at our
Lady of the Waters before mid-day strikes, having to accomplish my
devotions and offer my candles there, as well as at the crucifix of St.
Augustin; for I would not fail to do either, even though it were to snow
all day and blow a hurricane. What I came here for is to tell you, that
last night the Renegade and Centipede brought to my house a basket
somewhat larger than that now before us; it was as full as it could hold
of fine linen, and, on my life and soul, it was still wet and covered
with soap, just as they had taken it from under the nose of the
washerwoman, so that the poor fellows were perspiring and breathless
beneath its weight. It would have melted your heart to see them as they
came in, with the water streaming from their faces, and they as red as a
couple of cherubs. They told me, besides, that they were in pursuit of a
cattle-dealer, who had just had some sheep weighed at the
slaughter-house, and they were then hastening off to see if they could
not contrive to grab a great cat<a id="FNanchor_26_26"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_26_26" class="pginternal"><sup>[26]</sup></a> which the dealer carried with him.
They could not, therefore, spare time to count the linen, or take it out
of the basket but they relied on the rectitude of my conscience; and so
may God grant my honest desires, and preserve us all from the power of
justice, as these fingers have refrained from touching the basket, which
is as full as the day it was born."</p>
<p>"We cannot doubt it, good mother," replied Monipodio. "Let the basket
remain where it is; I will come at nightfall to fetch it away, and will
then ascertain the quantity and quality of its contents, giving to every
one the portion, due to him, faithfully and truly, as it is my habit to
do."</p>
<p>"Let it be as you shall command," rejoined the old woman; "and now, as
it is getting late, give me something to drink, if you have it
there—something that will comfort this miserable stomach, which is
almost famishing for want."</p>
<p>"That you shall have, and enough of it, mother," exclaimed Escalanta,
the companion of Gananciosa; and, uncovering the basket, she displayed a
great leather bottle, containing at least two arrobas<a id="FNanchor_27_27"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_27_27" class="pginternal"><sup>[27]</sup></a> of wine, with
a cup made of cork, in which you might comfortably carry off an
azumbre,<a id="FNanchor_28_28"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_28_28" class="pginternal"><sup>[28]</sup></a> or honest half-gallon of the same. This Escalanta now
filled, and placed it in the hands of the devout old woman, who took it
in both her own, and, having blown away a little froth from the surface,
she said,—</p>
<p>"You have poured out a large quantity, Escalanta, my daughter; but God
will give me strength." Whereupon, without once taking breath, and at
one draught, she poured the whole from the cup down her throat. "It is
real Guadalcanal,"<a id="FNanchor_29_29"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_29_29" class="pginternal"><sup>[29]</sup></a> said the old woman, when she had taken breath;
"and yet it has just a tiny smack of the gypsum. God comfort you, my
daughter, as you have comforted me; I am only afraid that the wine may
do me some mischief, seeing that I have not yet broken my fast."</p>
<p>"No, mother; it will do nothing of the kind," returned Monipodio, "for
it is three years old at the least."</p>
<p>"May the Virgin grant that I find it so," replied the old woman. Then
turning to the girls, "See, children," she said "whether you have not a
few maravedis to buy the candles for my offerings of devotion. I came
away in so much haste, to bring the news of the basket of linen, that I
forgot my purse, and left it at home."</p>
<p>"Yes, Dame Pipota,"—such was the name of the old woman,—"I have some,"
replied Gananciosa; "here are two cuartos for you, and with one of them
I beg you to buy a candle for me, which you will offer in my name to the
Señor St. Michael, or if you can get two with the money, you may place
the other at the altar of the Señor St. Blas, for those two are my
patron-saints. I also wish to give one to the Señora Santa Lucia, for
whom I have a great devotion, on account of the eyes;<a id="FNanchor_30_30"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_30_30" class="pginternal"><sup>[30]</sup></a> but I have no
more change to-day, so it must be put off till another time, when I
will square accounts with all."</p>
<p>"And you will do well, daughter," replied the old woman. "Don't be
niggard, mind. It is a good thing to carry one's own candles before one
dies, and not to wait until they are offered by the heirs and executors
of our testament."</p>
<p>"You speak excellently, Mother Pipota," said Escalanta; and, putting her
hand into her pocket, she drew forth a cuarto, which she gave the old
woman, requesting her to buy two candles for her likewise, and offer
them to such saints as she considered the most useful and the most
likely to be grateful. With this old Pipota departed, saying,</p>
<p>"Enjoy yourselves, my dears, now while you have time, for old age will
come and you will then weep for the moments you may have lost in your
youth, as I do now. Commend me to God in your prayers, and I will
remember you, as well as myself, in mine, that he may keep us all, and
preserve us in this dangerous trade of ours from all the terrors of
justice." These words concluded, the old woman went her way.</p>
<p>Dame Pipota having disappeared, all seated themselves round the mat,
which Gananciosa covered with the sheet in place of a table-cloth. The
first thing she drew from the basket was an immense bunch of radishes;
this was followed by a couple of dozens or more of oranges and lemons;
then came a great earthen pan filled with slices of fried ling, half a
Dutch cheese, a bottle of excellent olives, a plate of shrimps, and a
large dish of craw-fish, with their appropriate sauce of capers, drowned
in pepper-vinegar: three loaves of the whitest bread from Gandul
completed the collation. The number of guests at this breakfast was
fourteen, and not one of them failed to produce his yellow-handled
knife, Rinconete alone excepted, who drew his dudgeon dagger instead.
The two old men in serge gowns, and the lad who had been the guide of
the two friends, were charged with the office of cupbearers, pouring the
wine from the bottle into the cork cup.</p>
<p>But scarcely had the guests taken their places, before they were all
startled, and sprang up in haste at the, sound of repeated knocks at the
door. Bidding them remain quiet, Monipodio went into one of the lower
rooms, unhooked a buckler, took his sword in his hand, and, going to the
door, inquired, in a rough and threatening voice, "Who is there?"</p>
<p>"All right Señor! it is I, Tagarote,<a id="FNanchor_31_31"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_31_31" class="pginternal"><sup>[31]</sup></a> on sentry this morning,"
replied a voice from without. "I come to tell you that Juliana de
Cariharta<a id="FNanchor_32_32"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_32_32" class="pginternal"><sup>[32]</sup></a> is coming, with her hair all about her face, and crying
her eyes out, as though some great misfortune had happened to her."</p>
<p>He had scarcely spoken when the girl he had named came sobbing to the
door, which Monipodio opened for her, commanding Tagarote to return to
his post; and ordering him, moreover, to make less noise and uproar when
he should next bring notice of what was going forward,—a command to
which the boy promised attention.</p>
<p>Cariharta, a girl of the same class and profession with those already in
presence, had meanwhile entered the court, her hair streaming in the
wind, her eyes swollen with tears, and her face covered with contusions
and bruises. She had no sooner got into the Patio, than she fell to the
ground in a fainting fit. Gananciosa and Escalanta<a id="FNanchor_33_33"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_33_33" class="pginternal"><sup>[33]</sup></a> sprang to her
assistance, unfastened her dress, and found her breast and shoulders
blackened and covered with marks of violence. After they had thrown
water on her face, she soon came to herself, crying out as she did so,
"The justice of God and the king on that shameless thief, that cowardly
cut-purse, and dirty scoundrel, whom I have saved from the gibbet more
times than he has hairs in his beard. Alas! unhappy creature that I am!
see for what I have squandered my youth, and spent the flower of my
days! For an unnatural, worthless, and incorrigible villain!"</p>
<p>"Recover yourself, and be calm, Cariharta," said Monipodio; "I am here
to render justice to you and to all. Tell me your cause of complaint,
and you shall be longer in relating the story than I will be in taking
vengeance. Let me know if anything has happened between you and your
<i>respeto</i>;<a id="FNanchor_34_34"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_34_34" class="pginternal"><sup>[34]</sup></a> and if you desire to be well and duly avenged. You have
but to open your mouth."</p>
<p>"Protector!" exclaimed the girl. "What kind of a protector is he? It
were better for me to be protected in hell than to remain any longer
with that lion among sheep, and sheep among men! Will I ever eat again
with him at the same table, or live under the same roof? Rather would I
give this flesh of mine, which he has put into the state you shall see,
to be devoured alive by raging beasts." So saying, she pulled up her
petticoats to her knees, and even a little higher, and showed the wheals
with which she was covered. "That's the way," she cried, "that I have
been treated by that ungrateful Repolido,<a id="FNanchor_35_35"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_35_35" class="pginternal"><sup>[35]</sup></a> who owes more to me than
to the mother that bore him.</p>
<p>"And why do you suppose he has done this? Do you think I have given him
any cause?—no, truly. His only reason for serving me so was, that being
at play and losing his money, he sent Cabrillas, his scout, to me for
thirty reals, and I could only send him twenty-four. May the pains and
troubles with which I earned them be counted to me by heaven in
remission of my sins! But in return for this civility and kindness,
fancying that I had kept back part of what he chose to think I had got,
the blackguard lured me out to the fields this morning, beyond the
king's garden, and there, having stripped me among the olive trees, he
took off his belt, not even removing the iron buckle—oh that I may see
him clapped in irons and chains!—and with that he gave me such an
unmerciful flogging, that he left me for dead; and that's a true story,
as the marks you see bear witness."</p>
<p>Here Cariharta once more set up her pipes and craved for justice, which
was again promised to her by Monipodio and all the bravos present.</p>
<p>The Gananciosa then tried her hand at consoling the victim; saying to
her, among other things—"I would freely give my best gown that my fancy
man had done as much by me; for I would have you know, sister Cariharta,
if you don't know it yet, that he who loves best thrashes best; and when
these scoundrels whack us and kick us, it is then they most devoutly
adore us. Tell me now, on our life, after having beaten and abused you,
did not Repolido make much of you, and give you more than one caress?"</p>
<p>"More than one!" replied the weeping girl; "he gave me more than a
hundred thousand, and would have given a finger off his hand if I would
only have gone with him to his posada; nay, I even think that the tears
were almost starting from his eyes after he had leathered me."</p>
<p>"Not a doubt of it," replied Gananciosa; "and he would weep now to see
the state he has put you into: for men like him have scarcely committed
the fault before repentance begins. You will see, sister, if he does not
come here to look for you before we leave the place; and see if he does
not beg you to forgive what has passed, and behave to you as meek and as
humble as a lamb."</p>
<p>"By my faith," observed Monipodio, "the cowardly ruffian shall not enter
these doors until he has made full reparation for the offence he has
committed. How dare he lay a hand on poor Cariharta, who for cleanliness
and industry is a match for Gananciosa herself, and that is saying
everything."</p>
<p>"Alas! Señor Monipodio," replied Juliana, "please do not speak too
severely of the miserable fellow; for, hard as he is, I cannot but love
him as I do the very folds of my heart; and the words spoken in his
behalf by my friend Gananciosa have restored the soul to my body. Of a
truth, if I consulted only my own wishes, I should go this moment and
look for him."</p>
<p>"No, no," replied Gananciosa, "you shall not do so by my counsel; for to
do that would make him proud; he would think too much of himself, and
would make experiments upon you as on a dead body. Keep quiet, sister,
and in a short time you will see him here repentant, as I have said; and
if not, we will write verses on him that shall make him roar with rage."</p>
<p>"Let us write by all means," returned Juliana, "for I have a thousand
things to say to him."</p>
<p>"And I will be your secretary, if need be," rejoined Monipodio, "for
although I am no poet, yet a man has but to tuck up the sleeves of his
shirt, set well to work, and he may turn off a couple of thousand verses
in the snapping of a pair of scissors. Besides, if the rhymes should not
come so readily as one might wish, I have a friend close by, a barber,
who is a great poet, and will trim up the ends of the verses at an
hour's notice. At present, however, let us go finish our repast; all the
rest can be done afterwards."</p>
<p>Juliana was not unwilling to obey her superior, so they all fell to
again at the O-be-joyful with so much goodwill that they soon saw the
bottom of the basket and the dregs of the great leather bottle. The old
ones drank <i>sine fine</i>, the younger men to their hearts' content, and
the ladies till they could drink no more. When all was consumed, the two
old men begged permission to take their leave, which Monipodio allowed
them to do, but charged them to return punctually, for the purpose of
reporting all they should see or hear that could be useful to the
brotherhood; they assured him they would by no means fail in their duty,
and then departed.</p>
<p>After these gentlemen had left the company, Rinconete, who was of a very
inquiring disposition, begged leave to ask Monipodio in what way two
persons so old, grave, and formal as those he had just seen, could be of
service to their community. Monipodio replied, that such were called
"Hornets" in their jargon, and that their office was to poke about all
parts of the city, spying out such places as might be eligible for
attempts to be afterwards made in the night-time. "They watch people who
receive money from the bank or treasury," said he, "observe where they
go with it, and, if possible, the very place in which it is deposited.
When this is done, they make themselves acquainted with the thickness of
the walls, marking out the spot where we may most conveniently make our
<i>guzpataros</i>, which are the holes whereby we contrive to force an
entrance. In a word, these persons are among the most useful of the
brotherhood: and they receive a fifth of all that the community obtains
by their intervention, as his majesty does, on treasure trove. They are,
moreover, men of singular integrity and rectitude. They lead a
respectable life, and enjoy a good reputation, fearing God and regarding
the voice of their consciences, insomuch that not a day passes over
their heads in which they have not heard mass with extraordinary
devotion. There are, indeed, some of them so conscientious, that they
content themselves with even less than by our rules would be their due.
Those just gone are of this number. We have two others, whose trade it
is to remove furniture; and as they are daily employed in the conveyance
of articles for persons who are changing their abode, they know all the
ins and outs of every house in the city, and can tell exactly where we
may hope for profit and where not."</p>
<p>"That is all admirable," replied Rinconete, "and greatly do I desire to
be of some use to so noble a confraternity."</p>
<p>"Heaven is always ready to favour commendable desires," replied
Monipodio.</p>
<p>While the two were thus discoursing, a knock was heard at the door, and
Monipodio went to see who might be there. "Open, Sor<a id="FNanchor_36_36"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_36_36" class="pginternal"><sup>[36]</sup></a>
Monipodio—open," said a voice without; "it is I, Repolido."</p>
<p>Cariharta hearing this voice, began to lift up her own to heaven, and
cried out, "Don't open the door, Señor Monipodio; don't let in that
Tarpeian mariner—that tiger of Ocaña."<a id="FNanchor_37_37"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_37_37" class="pginternal"><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>
<p>Monipodio opened the door, nevertheless, in despite of her cries; when
Cariharta, starting to her feet, hurried away, and hid herself in the
room where the bucklers were hung up. There, bolting the door, she
bawled from her refuge, "Drive out that black-visaged coward, that
murderer of innocents, that white-livered terror of house-lambs, who
durst not look a man in the face."</p>
<p>Repolido was meanwhile kept back by Maniferro and Chiquiznaque, as he
struggled with all his might to get into the room where Cariharta was
hidden. But when he saw that to be impossible, he called to her from
without, "Come, come, let us have done with this, my little sulky; by
your life, let us have peace, as you would wish to be married."
"Married!" retorted the lady, "married to you too! Don't you wish you
may get it? See what kind of a string he's playing on now. I would
rather be married to a dead notomy." "Oh, bother!" exclaimed Repolido;
"let us have done with this, for it is getting late; take care of being
too much puffed up at hearing me speak so gently, and seeing me so meek;
for, by the light of heaven, if my rage should get steeple-high, the
relapse will be worse than the first fit. Come down from your stilts,
let us all have done with our <i>tantrums</i>, and not give the devil a
dinner."</p>
<p>"I will give him a supper to boot, if he will take you from my sight to
some place where I may never set eyes on you more," exclaimed the gentle
Juliana from within.</p>
<p>"Haven't I told you once to beware, Madame Hemp-sack? By the powers, I
suspect I must serve out something to you by the dozen, though I make no
charge for it."</p>
<p>Here Monipodio interposed: "In my presence," he said, "there shall be no
violence. Cariharta will come out, not for your threats, but for my
sake, and all will go well. Quarrels between people who love each other
are but the cause of greater joy and pleasure when peace is once made.
Listen to me, Juliana, my daughter; listen to me, my Cariharta. Come out
to us, for the love of your friend Monipodio, and I will make Repolido
beg your pardon on his knees."</p>
<p>"Ah! if he will do that," exclaimed Escalanta, "we shall then be all on
his side, and will entreat Juliana to come out."</p>
<p>"If I am asked to beg pardon in a sense of submission that would
dishonour my person," replied Repolido, "an army of lansquenets would
not make me consent; but if it be merely in the way of doing pleasure to
Cariharta, I do not say merely that I would go on my knees, but I would
drive a nail into my forehead to do her service."</p>
<p>At these words Chiquiznaque and Maniferro began to laugh, and Repolido,
who thought they were making game of him, cried out in a transport of
rage, "Whoever shall laugh or think of laughing at anything whatsoever
that may pass between Cariharta and myself, I say that he lies, and that
he will have lied every time he shall laugh or think of laughing."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Chiquiznaque and Maniferro looked at each other and
scowled so sternly, that Monipodio saw things were likely to come to a
crisis unless he prevented it. Throwing himself, therefore, into the
midst of the group, he cried out, "No more of this, gentlemen! have done
with all big words; grind them up between your teeth; and since those
that have been said do not reach to the belt, let no one here apply them
to himself."</p>
<p>"We are very sure," replied Chiquiznaque, "that such admonitions neither
have been nor will be uttered for our benefit; otherwise, or if it
should be imagined that they were addressed to us, the tambourine is in
hands that would well know how to beat it."</p>
<p>"We also, Sor Chiquiznaque, have our drum of Biscay," retorted
Repolido, "and, in case of need, can make the bells as well as another.
I have already said, that whoever jests in our matters is a liar: and
whoever thinks otherwise, let him follow me; with a palm's length of my
sword I will show him that what is said is said." Having uttered these
words, Repolido turned towards the outer door, and proceeded to leave
the place.</p>
<p>Cariharta had meanwhile been listening to all this, and when she found
that Repolido was departing in anger, she rushed out, screaming, "Hold
him, hold him,—don't let him go, or he will be showing us some more of
his handiwork; can't you see that he is angry? and he is a Judas
Macarelo in the matter of bravery. Come here, Hector of the world and of
my eyes!" With these words, Cariharta threw herself upon the retiring
bravo, and held him with all her force by his cloak. Monipodio lent her
his aid, and between them they contrived to detain him.</p>
<p>Chiquiznaque and Maniferro, undetermined whether to resume the dispute
or not, stood waiting apart to see what Repolido would do, and the
latter perceiving himself to be in the hands of Monipodio and Cariharta,
exclaimed, "Friends should never annoy friends, nor make game of
friends, more especially when they see that friends are vexed."</p>
<p>"There is not a friend here," replied Maniferro, "who has any desire to
vex a friend; and since we are all friends, let us give each other the
hand like friends." "Your worships have all spoken like good friends,"
added Monipodio, "and as such friends should do; now finish by giving
each other your hands like true friends."</p>
<p>All obeyed instantly, whereupon Escalanta, whipping off her cork-soled
clog, began to play upon it as if it had been a tambourine. Gananciosa,
in her turn, caught up a broom, and, scratching the rushes with her
fingers, drew forth a sound which, if not soft or sweet, yet agreed very
well with the beating of the slipper. Monipodio then broke a plate, the
two fragments of which he rattled together in such fashion as to make a
very praiseworthy accompaniment to the slipper and the broom.</p>
<p>Rinconete and Cortadillo stood in much admiration of that new invention
of the broom, for up to that time they had seen nothing like it.
Maniferro perceived their amazement, and said to them, "The broom
awakens your admiration,—and well it may, since a more convenient kind
of instrument was never invented in this world, nor one more readily
formed, or less costly. Upon my life, I heard a student the other day
affirm, that neither the man who fetched his wife out of hell—Negrofeo,
Ogrofeo, or what was he called—nor that Marion who got upon a dolphin,
and came out of the sea like a man riding on a hired mule—nor even that
other great musician who built a city with a hundred gates and as many
posterns—never a one of them invented an instrument half so easy of
acquirement, so ready to the touch, so pleasing and simple as to its
frets, keys, and chords, and so far from troublesome in the tuning and
keeping in accord; and by all the saints, they swear that it was
invented by a gallant of this very city, a perfect Hector in matters of
music."</p>
<p>"I fully believe all you say," replied Rinconete, "but let us listen,
for our musicians are about to sing. Gananciosa is blowing her nose,
which is a certain sign that she means to sing."</p>
<p>And she was, in fact, preparing to do so. Monipodio had requested her to
give the company some of the Seguidillas most in vogue at the moment.
But the first to begin was Escalanta, who sang as follows, in a thin
squeaking voice:—</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"For a boy of Sevilla,<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">Red as a Dutchman,<br/>
</span>
<span>All my heart's in flame."<br/>
</span>
</div></div>
<p>To which Gananciosa replied, taking up the measure as she best might—</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"For the little brown lad,<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">With a good bright eye,<br/>
</span>
<span>Who would not lose her name?"<br/>
</span>
</div></div>
<p>Then Monipodio, making great haste to perform a symphony with his pieces
of platter, struck in—</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"Two lovers dear, fall out and fight,<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">But soon, to make their peace, take leisure;<br/>
</span>
<span>And all the greater was the row,<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">So much the greater is the pleasure."<br/>
</span>
</div></div>
<p>But Cariharta had no mind to enjoy her recovered happiness in silence
and fingering another clog, she also entered the dance, joining her
voice to those of her friends, in the following words—</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"Pause, angry lad! and do not beat me more,<br/>
</span>
<span class="i2">For 'tis thine own dear flesh that thou dost baste,<br/>
</span>
<span>If thou but well consider, and—"<br/>
</span>
</div></div>
<p>"Fair and soft," exclaimed Repolido, at that moment, "give us no old
stories, there's no good in that. Let bygones be bygones! Choose another
gait, girl; we've had enough of that one."</p>
<p>The canticle, for a moment interrupted by these words, was about to
recommence, and would not, apparently, have soon come to an end, had not
the performers been disturbed by violent knocks at the door. Monipodio
hastened to see who was there, and found one of his sentinels, who
informed him that at the end of the street was the alcalde of criminal
justice, with the little Piebald and the Kestrel (two catchpolls, who
were called neutral, since they did the community of robbers neither
good nor harm), marching before him.</p>
<p>The joyous company within heard the report of their scout, and were in a
terrible fright. Escalanta and Cariharta put on their clogs in great
haste, Gananciosa threw down her broom, and Monipodio his broken plate,
every instrument sinking at once into silence. Chiquiznaque lost his
joyous grin, and stood dumb as a fish; Repolido trembled with fear, and
Maniferro looked pale with anxiety. But these various demonstrations
were exhibited only for a moment,—in the next, all that goodly
brotherhood had disappeared. Some rushed across a kind of terrace, and
gained another court; others clambered over the roof, and so passed into
a neighbouring alley. Never did the sound of a fowling piece, or a
sudden peal of thunder, more effectually disperse a flock of careless
pigeons, than did the news of the alcalde's arrival that select company
assembled in the house of the Señor Monipodio. Rinconete and Cortadillo,
not knowing whither to flee, stood in their places waiting to see what
would be the end of that sudden storm, which finished simply enough by
the return of the sentinel, who came to say that the alcalde had passed
through the whole length of the street without seeming to have any
troublesome suspicions respecting them, or even appearing to think of
their house at all.</p>
<p>While Monipodio was in the act of receiving this last report, there
came to the door a gentleman in the prime of youth, and dressed in the
half-rustic manner suitable to the morning, or to one residing in the
country. Monipodio caused this person to enter the house with himself;
he then sent to look for Chiquiznaque, Repolido, and Maniferro, with
orders that they should come forth from their hiding places, but that
such others as might be with them should remain where they were.</p>
<p>Rinconete and Cortadillo having remained in the court, could hear all
the conversation which took place between Monipodio and the gentleman
who had just arrived, and who began by inquiring how it happened that
the job he had ordered had been so badly done. At this point of the
colloquy, Chiquiznaque appeared, and Monipodio asked him if he had
accomplished the work with which he had been entrusted—namely, the
knife-slash of fourteen stitches.<a id="FNanchor_38_38"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_38_38" class="pginternal"><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>
<p>"Which of them was it," inquired Chiquiznaque, "that of the merchant at
the Cross-ways?" "Exactly," replied the gentleman. "Then I'll tell you
how the matter went," responded the bravo. "Last night, as I watched
before the very door of his house, and the man appeared just before to
the ringing of the <i>Ave Maria</i>, I got near him, and took the measure of
his face with my eyes; but I perceived it was so small that it was
impossible, totally impossible, to find room in it for a cut of fourteen
stitches. So that, perceiving myself unable to fulfil my
destructions"—"Instructions you mean," said the gentleman;—"Well,
well, instructions if you will," admitted Chiquiznaque,—"seeing that I
could not find room for the number of stitches I had to make, because of
the narrowness, I say, and want of space in the visage of the merchant,
I gave the cut to a lacquey he had with him, to the end that I might not
have my journey for nothing; and certainly his allowance may pass for
one of the best quality."</p>
<p>"I would rather you had given the master a cut of seven stitches than
the servant one of fourteen," remarked the gentleman. "You have not
fulfilled the promise made me, but the thirty ducats which I gave you as
earnest money, will be no great loss." This said, he saluted the two
ruffians and turned to depart, but Monipodio detained him by the cloak
of mixed cloth which he wore on his shoulders, saying: "Be pleased to
stop, Señor cavalier, and fulfil your promise, since we have kept our
word with strict honour and to great advantage. Twenty ducats are still
wanting to our bargain, and your worship shall not go from this place
until you have paid them, or left us something of equal value in
pledge."</p>
<p>"Do you call this keeping your word," said the gentleman, "making a cut
on the servant when you should have made it on the master?"</p>
<p>"How well his worship understands the business," remarked Chiquiznaque.
"One can easily see that he does not remember the proverb which says:
'He who loves Beltran, loves his dog likewise.'"</p>
<p>"But what has this proverb to do with the matter?" inquired the
gentleman.</p>
<p>"Why, is it not the same thing as to say, 'He who loves Beltran ill,
loves his dog ill too?' Now the master is Beltran, whom you love ill,
and the servant is his dog; thus in giving the cut to the dog I have
given it to Beltran, and our part of the agreement is fulfilled; the
work has been properly done, and nothing remains but to pay for it on
the spot and without further delay."</p>
<p>"That is just what I am ready to swear to," cried Monipodio; "and you,
friend Chiquiznaque, have taken all that you have said from my mouth;
wherefore let not your worship, Señor gallant, be making difficulties
out of trifles with your friends and servants. Take my advice and pay us
what is our due. After that, if your worship would like to have another
cut given to the master, of as many stitches as the space can contain,
consider that they are already sewing up the wound."</p>
<p>"If it be so," said the gentleman, "I will very willingly pay the whole
sum."</p>
<p>"Make no more doubt of it than of my being a good Christian, for
Chiquiznaque will set the mark on his face so neatly, that he shall seem
to have been born with it."</p>
<p>"On this promise, then, and with this assurance," replied the gentleman,
"receive this chain in pledge for the twenty ducats before agreed on,
and for forty other ducats which I will give you for the cut that is to
come. The chain weighs a thousand reals, and it may chance to remain
with you altogether, as I have an idea that I shall want fourteen
stitches more before long."</p>
<p>Saying this, he took a chain from his neck, and put it into the hands of
Monipodio, who found immediately by the weight and touch that it was not
gold made by the chemist, but the true metal. He received it accordingly
with great pleasure and much courtesy, for Monipodio was particularly
well-bred. The execution of the work to be done for it was committed to
Chiquiznaque, who declared that it should be delayed no longer than till
the arrival of night. The gentleman then departed, well satisfied with
his bargain.</p>
<p>Monipodio now summoned the confraternity from the hiding places into
which their terror had driven them. When all had entered, he placed
himself in the midst of them, drew forth a memorandum book from the hood
of his cloak, and as he himself could not read, he handed it to
Rinconete, who opened it, and read as follows:—</p>
<p>"Memoranda of the cuts to be given this week.</p>
<p>"The first is to the merchant at the Cross-ways, and is worth fifty
crowns, thirty of which have been received on account. <i>Secutor</i>,<a id="FNanchor_39_39"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_39_39" class="pginternal"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
Chiquiznaque.</p>
<p>"I believe there are no others, my son," said Monipodio; "go on and look
for the place where it is written, 'Memoranda of blows with a cudgel.'"
Rinconete turned to that heading, and found under it this entry:—"To
the keeper of the pot-house called the Trefoil, twelve blows, to be laid
on in the best style, at a crown a-piece, eight of which crowns have
been received; time of execution, within six days. <i>Secutor</i>,
Maniferro."</p>
<p>"That article may be scratched out of the account," remarked Maniferro,
"for to-night I shall give the gentleman his due."</p>
<p>"Is there not another, my son?" asked Monipodio.</p>
<p>"There is," replied Rinconete, and he read as follows:—</p>
<p>"To the hunch-backed Tailor, called by the nick-name Silguero,<a id="FNanchor_40_40"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_40_40" class="pginternal"><sup>[40]</sup></a> six
blows of the best sort for the lady whom he compelled to leave her
necklace in pledge with him. <i>Secutor</i>, the Desmochado." <a id="FNanchor_41_41"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_41_41" class="pginternal"><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>
<p>"I am surprised to find this article still on the account," observed
Monipodio, "seeing that two days have elapsed since it ought to have
been taken off the book; and yet the secutor has not done his work.
Desmochado must be indisposed."</p>
<p>"I met him yesterday," said Maniferro. "He is not ill himself, but the
Hunchback has been so, and being confined to the house on that account,
the Desmochado has been unable to encounter him."</p>
<p>"I make no doubt of it," rejoined Monipodio, "for I consider the
Desmochado to be so good a workman, that but for some such reasonable
impediment he would certainly before this have finished a job of much
greater importance. Is there any more, my boy?" "No, Señor," replied
Rinconete. "Turn over, then, till you find the 'Memorandum of
miscellaneous damages.'"</p>
<p>Rinconete found the page inscribed "Memorandum of miscellaneous
damages," namely, Radomagos,<a id="FNanchor_42_42"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_42_42" class="pginternal"><sup>[42]</sup></a> greasing with oil of juniper, clapping

befoolings, <i>calomels</i>,<a id="FNanchor_44_44"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_44_44" class="pginternal"><sup>[44]</sup></a> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>"What do you find lower down?" inquired Monipodio. "I find, 'Greasing
with oil of juniper at the house in—'" "Don't read the place or name
of the house," interrupted Monipodio, "for we know where it is, and I am
myself the <i>tuautem</i> and <i>secutor</i> of this trifling matter; four crowns
have already been given on account, and the total is eight." "That is
exactly what is here written," replied Rinconete. "A little lower down,"
continued the boy, "I find, 'Horns to be attached to the house—'" "Read
neither the name nor the place where," interrupted Monipodio. "It is
quite enough that we offer this outrage to the people in question; we
need not make it public in our community, for that would be an
unnecessary load on your consciences. I would rather nail a hundred
horns, and as many sanbenitos, on a man's door, provided I were paid for
my work, than once tell that I had done so, were it to the mother that
bore me." "The executor of this is Nariqueta,"<a id="FNanchor_45_45"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_45_45" class="pginternal"><sup>[45]</sup></a> resumed Rinconete.
"It is already done and paid for," said Monipodio; "see if there be not
something else, for if my memory is not at fault, there ought to be a
fright of the value of twenty crowns. One half the money has already
been paid, and the work is to be done by the whole community, the time
within which it is to come off being all the current month. Nor will we
fail in our duty; the commission shall be fulfilled to the very letter
without missing a tilde,<a id="FNanchor_46_46"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_46_46" class="pginternal"><sup>[46]</sup></a> and it will be one of the finest things
that has been executed in this city for many years. Give me the book,
boy, I know there is nothing more, and it is certain that business is
very slack with us just now; but times will mend, and we shall perhaps
have more to do than we want. There is not a leaf on the tree that moves
without the will of God, and we cannot force people to avenge
themselves, whether they will or not. Besides, many a man has the habit
of being brave in his own cause, and does not care to pay for the
execution of work which he can do as well with his own hands."</p>
<p>"That is true," said Repolido; "but will your worship, Señor Monipodio,
see what you have for us to do, as it is getting late, and the heat is
coming on at more than a foot-pace."</p>
<p>"What you have now to do is this," rejoined Monipodio: "Every one is to
return to his post of the week, and is not to change it until Sunday. We
will then meet here again, and make the distribution of all that shall
have come in, without defrauding any one. To Rinconete and Cortadillo I
assign for their district, until Sunday, from the Tower of Gold, all
without the city, and to the postern of the Alcazar, where they can work
with their fine flowers.<a id="FNanchor_47_47"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_47_47" class="pginternal"><sup>[47]</sup></a> I have known those who were much less
clever than they appear to be, come home daily with more than twenty
reals in small money, to say nothing of silver, all made with a single
pack, and that four cards short. Ganchuelo will show them the limits of
their district, and even though they should extend it as far as to San
Sebastian, or Santelmo, there will be no great harm done, although it is
perhaps of more equal justice that none should enter on the domain of
another."</p>
<p>The two boys kissed his hand in acknowledgment of the favour he was
doing them; and promised to perform their parts zealously and
faithfully, and with all possible caution and prudence.</p>
<p>Monipodio then drew from the hood of his cloak a folded paper, on which
was the list of the brotherhood, desiring Rinconete to inscribe his name
thereon, with that of Cortadillo; but as there was no escritoire in the
place, he gave them the paper to take with them, bidding them enter the
first apothecary's shop they could find, and there write what was
needful: "Rinconete, and Cortadillo," namely, "comrades; novitiate,
none; Rinconete, a florist; Cortadillo, a bassoon-player."<a id="FNanchor_48_48"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_48_48" class="pginternal"><sup>[48]</sup></a> To this
was to be added the year, month, and day, but not the parents or
birthplace.</p>
<p>At this moment one of the old hornets came in and said, "I come to tell
your worships that I have just now met on the steps, Lobillo<a id="FNanchor_49_49"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_49_49" class="pginternal"><sup>[49]</sup></a> of
Malaga, who tells me that he has made such progress in his art as to be
capable of cheating Satan himself out of his money, if he have but clean
cards. He is so ragged and out of condition at this moment, that he
dares not instantly make his appearance to register himself, and pay his
respects as usual, but will be here without fail on Sunday."</p>
<p>"I have always been convinced," said Monipodio, "that Lobillo would some
day become supereminent in his art, for he has the best hands for the
purpose that have ever been seen; and to be a good workman in his trade,
a man should be possessed of good tools, as well as capacity for
learning."</p>
<p>"I have also met the Jew," returned the hornet; "he wears the garb of a
priest, and is at a tavern in the Street of the Dyers, because he has
learned that two Peruleros<a id="FNanchor_50_50"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_50_50" class="pginternal"><sup>[50]</sup></a> are now stopping there. He wishes to try
if he cannot do business with them, even though it should be but in a
trifling way to begin; for from small endeavours often come great
achievements. He, too, will be here on Sunday, and will then give an
account of himself."</p>
<p>"The Jew is a keen hawk too," observed Monipodio, "but it is long since
I have set eyes on him, and he does not do well in staying away, for, by
my faith, if he do not mend, I will cut his crown for him. The scoundrel
has received orders as much as the Grand Turk, and knows no more Latin
than my grandmother. Have you anything further to report?"</p>
<p>The old man replied that he had not. "Very well," said Monipodio; "Take
this trifle among you," distributing at the same time some forty reals
among those assembled, "and do not fail to be here on Sunday, when there
shall be nothing wanting of the booty." All returned him thanks.
Repolido and Cariharta embraced each other; so did Maniferro and
Escalanta, and Chiquiznaque and Gananciosa; and all agreed that they
would meet that same evening, when they left off work at the house of
Dame Pipota, whither Monipodio likewise promised to repair, for the
examination of the linen announced in the morning, before he went to his
job with the juniper oil.</p>
<p>The master finally embraced Rinconete and Cortadillo, giving them his
benediction; he then dismissed them, exhorting them to have no fixed
dwelling or known habitation, since that was a precaution most important
to the safety of all. Ganchuelo accompanied the friends for the purpose
of guiding them to their districts, and pointing out the limits thereof.
He warned them on no account to miss the assembly on Sunday, when it
seemed that Monipodio intended to give them a lecture on matters
concerning their profession. That done, the lad went away, leaving the
two novices in great astonishment at all they had seen.</p>
<p>Now Rinconete, although very young, had a good understanding, and much
intelligence. Having often accompanied his father in the sale of his
bulls, he had acquired the knowledge of a more refined language than
that they had just been hearing, and laughed with all his heart as he
recalled the expressions used by Monipodio, and the other members of the
respectable community they had entered. He was especially entertained by
the solecising sanctimonies; and by Cariharta calling Repolido a
Tarpeian Mariner, and a Tiger of Ocaña. He was also mightily edified by
the expectation of Cariharta that the pains she had taken to earn the
twenty-four reals would be accepted in heaven as a set-off against her
sins, and was amazed to see with what security they all counted on
going to heaven by means of the devotions they performed,
notwithstanding the many thefts, homicides, and other offences against
God and their neighbour which they were daily committing. The boy
laughed too with all his heart, as he thought of the good old woman
Pipota, who suffered the basket of stolen linen to be concealed in her
house, and then went to place her little wax candles before the images
of the saints, expecting thereby to enter heaven full dressed in her
mantle and clogs.</p>
<p>But he was most surprised at the respect and deference which all these
people paid to Monipodio, whom he saw to be nothing better than a coarse
and brutal barbarian. He recalled the various entries which he had read
in the singular memorandum-book of the burly thief, and thought over all
the various occupations in which that goodly company was hourly engaged.
Pondering all these things, he could not but marvel at the carelessness
with which justice was administered in that renowned city of Seville,
since such pernicious hordes and inhuman ruffians were permitted to live
there almost openly.</p>
<p>He determined to dissuade his companion from continuing long in such a
reprobate course of life. Nevertheless, led away by his extreme youth,
and want of experience, he remained with these people for some months,
during which there happened to him adventures which would require much
writing to detail them; wherefore I propose to remit the description of
his life and adventures to some other occasion, when I will also relate
those of his master, Monipodio, with other circumstances connected with
the members of that infamous academy, which may serve as warnings to
those who read them.</p>
