<body class="x-ebookmaker x-ebookmaker-2"><p>At the unexpected sight of such unparalleled loveliness, Ali felt his
heart transfixed; Hassan's was pierced with as deep a wound; nor did the
cadi's escape scatheless, but, even more deeply smitten than the two
pashas, he could not take his eyes off the Christian's face. All three
were seized at the same moment with an absolute determination to possess
her; and without stopping to inquire how, or where, or when, she had
come into the hands of the Jew, they bade him name her price. Four
thousand doblas, he replied. The words were no sooner out of the Jew's
mouth than Ali Pasha said he would give the price, and that the Jew had
only to go to his tent to fetch the money. Hassan Pasha, however, who
looked as if he had no mind to lose her, though she were to cost him his
life, interposed and said, "I myself will give the four thousand doblas
demanded by the Jew, though I would not interfere with Ali's bargain or
oppose his wishes, were I not compelled by motives the imperious force
and obligation of which he will himself acknowledge. This exquisitely
beautiful slave is not for us, but for the Grand Signor alone, and
therefore I say that I purchase her in his name. Let us see now who will
be so bold as to dispute the purchase with me."</p>
<p>"That will I," replied Ali, "for it is for that very purpose I buy her
of the Jew; and it suits me the better to make the present to his
Highness, as I have the opportunity of taking her to Constantinople in a
few days, and thus winning the favour of the Sultan; for being, as you
see, Hassan, a man without employment, I must seek means for obtaining
one; whereas, you are secure in that respect for three years, since
to-day you enter upon the government of this rich realm of Cyprus. On
these grounds, and as I was the first to offer the price demanded for
the slave, it stands to reason, Hassan, that you should yield her to
me."</p>
<p>"The satisfaction I shall feel in purchasing and sending her to the
Sultan," said Hassan, "is so much the greater, as I shall do it without
being prompted by any motives of interest whatever. And as for a
convenient means of sending her to Constantinople, she shall go thither
in a galley manned only by my own slaves."</p>
<p>Ali now started up in wrath, and, clutching his scimetar, cried out,
"Since we both intend the same thing, Hassan, namely, to present this
Christian to the Grand Signor, and since I was the first purchaser,
reason and justice require that you should leave her to me; if you will
not, this blade in my hand shall defend my right, and punish your
audacity."</p>
<p>The cadi, who had been closely watching this contest, and who was
himself no less inflamed with desire than either of the pashas,
bethought him how he might remain possessor of the prize, without giving
any cause to suspect his insidious designs. Rising therefore to his
feet, he stepped between the two angry pashas. "Be quiet, Hassan," he
said; "calm yourself, Ali; here am I who can and will arrange your
differences in such wise that you shall both have your intentions
fulfilled, the Sultan shall be gratified as you desire, and shall be
under obligations to you both alike for your loyal and acceptable
homage."</p>
<p>The two pashas submitted at once to the cadi, as they would have done
even had the terms he imposed appeared harder to them, such is the
respect which is paid to their elders by those of that accursed sect.
The cadi then continued his address to them. "Ali," said he, "you say
that you want this Christian to present her to the Grand Signor; and
Hassan says the same. You allege that, having been the first to offer
the price required, she ought to be yours; but Hassan denies this; and
though he does not know how to assign valid grounds for his claim, yet I
find that he has the same as yourself, namely, the intention, which
doubtless must have arisen within him at the same time as within
yourself, to purchase the slave for the self-same purpose; only you had
the advantage of him in being the first to declare yourself. This,
however, is no reason why he should be out and out defrauded of the
benefit of his good-will, and therefore I am of opinion that it will be
well to arrange matters between you in this wise: let the slave be
bought by you both; and since she is to belong to the Grand Signor, for
whom you buy her, it will be for him to dispose of her. Meanwhile, you
Hassan shall pay two thousand doblas, and you Ali another two thousand,
and the slave shall remain in my custody, so that I may send her in the
name of you both to Constantinople, and thus I too shall not be without
some reward for my presence and aid on this occasion. Accordingly, I
undertake to send her at my own cost in a style worthy of the great
sovereign to whom she is to be presented; and I will write to the Grand
Signor a true account of all that has occurred here, and of the
good-will you have shown in his service."</p>
<p>The two enamoured pashas could find no pretext for gainsaying this
decision; and though it thwarted their desires, they were constrained to
submit, each of them comforting himself with the hope, however doubtful,
that he would succeed at last. Hassan, who was to remain viceroy of
Cyprus, resolved to make such presents to the cadi as would induce him
to give up the slave. Ali formed other plans, and as he flattered
himself that he should carry them into successful operation, they both
professed themselves satisfied, and paid the Jew two thousand doblas
each on the spot. The Jew then said that he had sold the slave, but not
the clothes she wore, which were worth another two thousand doblas; and
this indeed was true, for her hair which she wore partly loose on her
shoulders, and partly braided on her forehead, was most gracefully
interwoven with strings of pearls; her bracelets and anklets too were
set with very large pearls, and her green satin robe was heavily
flounced and embroidered with gold. In short, all agreed that the Jew
had set a low price on the dress, and the cadi, to show himself no less
liberal than the two pashas, said that he would pay for it, that the
slave might appear before the Grand Signor as she then stood. The two
competitors agreed in approving of this, each of them believing that
slave, dress, and all would soon be his own.</p>
<p>It is impossible to describe Ricardo's feelings, when he saw the
treasure of his soul thus put up for sale, and found that he had
regained it only to lose it more cruelly. He knew not whether he was
asleep or awake, and could not believe his own eyes; for it seemed
incredible that they should have so unexpectedly before them her whom he
had supposed to have disappeared for ever. "Do you know her?" he
whispered in Mahmoud's ear.</p>
<p>"No! I do not," was the reply.</p>
<p>"Then I must tell you that it is Leonisa."</p>
<p>"What do you say, Ricardo?" exclaimed Mahmoud.</p>
<p>"I say it is Leonisa."</p>
<p>"Say no more; fortune is proving your friend, and all is turning out for
the best, for she is to remain in my master's custody."</p>
<p>"What think you? Shall I place myself where I may be seen by her?"</p>
<p>"By no means, lest you give her a sudden shock; nor must you let it be
known that you have seen her, for that might disconcert the plan I have
in view."</p>
<p>"I will do as you advise," said Ricardo, turning away his eyes, and
carefully avoiding those of Leonisa, which were meanwhile bent upon the
ground. Presently the cadi went up to her, and taking her by the hand,
delivered her to Mahmoud, ordering him to take her into the city and
give her up to his lady, Halema, with directions to keep her as a slave
of the Grand Signor. Mahmoud obeyed and left Ricardo alone, following
with his eyes the star of his soul, until it disappeared behind the
walls of Nicosia. He then went up to the Jew, and asked him where he had
bought that Christian slave, or how he had become possessed of her. The
Jew replied that he had bought her in the island of Pantanalea, of some
Turks who had been shipwrecked there. Ricardo would have pursued his
inquiries, but the Jew was called away to give the pashas the very same
information which Ricardo so much longed to obtain.</p>
<p>During the long walk from the tents to the city Mahmoud conversed with
Leonisa in Italian, and asked her whence she came. She replied that she
belonged to the illustrious city of Trapani, and that her parents were
noble and wealthy, though as for herself she was utterly unfortunate.
Mahmoud then asked her if she knew a gentleman of birth and fortune in
that city, named Ricardo. On hearing that name a sigh escaped her that
seemed to come from the bottom of her heart. "I know him," she replied,
"to my sorrow."</p>
<p>"Why to your sorrow?"</p>
<p>"Because it was to his sorrow that he knew me, and for my misfortune."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," said Mahmoud, "you may also know in the same city another
gentleman of very amiable disposition, the son of very wealthy parents,
and himself a person of great spirit, liberality, and discretion. His
name is Cornelio."</p>
<p>"Him too I know, and of him still more than Ricardo I may say that I
know him to my sorrow. But who are you, sir, who know these gentlemen
and inquire of me respecting them? Doubtless, Heaven, in compassion for
the trouble and mischances I have undergone, has sent me to a place
where, if they do not cease, at least I may find a person to console me
for them."</p>
<p>"I am a native of Palermo," said Mahmoud, "brought by various chances to
wear this garb, and to be in appearance so different from what I am in
my secret soul. I know the gentlemen in question, because not many days
ago they were with me. Cornelio was captured by some Moors of Tripoli,
and sold by them to a Turk who brought him to this island, whither he
came to trade, for he is a merchant of Rhodes, and so highly satisfied
was he with Cornelio, and such was the confidence he reposed in his
truth and integrity, that he entrusted him with his whole property."</p>
<p>"He will be sure to take care of it," said Leonisa, "for he takes very
good care of his own. But tell me, señor, how or with whom did Ricardo
come to this island?"</p>
<p>"He came," said Mahmoud, "with a corsair who had captured him in a
garden on the coast near Trapani, and along with him a damsel, whose
name I never thought of asking, though the corsair often spoke to me in
praise of her beauty. Ricardo remained hero some days with his master
until the latter went to visit the tomb of Mahomet, which is in the city
of Almedina,<a id="FNanchor_77_77"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-10.htm.html#Footnote_77_77" class="pginternal"><sup>[77]</sup></a> and then Ricardo fell into such a sickness that his
master left him with me, as being my countryman, that I might take care
of him until the return of the pilgrim to Cyprus, should that happen; or
else I was to send Ricardo to Constantinople, when his master should
advise me of his arrival there. But heaven ordered it otherwise; for the
unfortunate Ricardo died in a few days, always invoking to the last the
name of one Leonisa, whom he had told me he loved more than his life and
soul. She had been drowned, he said, in the wreck of a galley on the
coast of the island of Pantanalea; and he never ceased to deplore her
death till his grief destroyed him, for that in fact was the only malady
I discovered in him."</p>
<p>"Tell me, señor," said Leonisa, "in the conversations you had with the
other young man, did he sometimes name this Leonisa? Did he relate the
manner in which he and she and Ricardo were captured?"</p>
<p>"He did name her," replied Mahmoud, "and asked me if there had been
brought to this island a Christian of that name, of such and such
appearance; for if so he should like to ransom her, provided her owner
had been undeceived as to his notion that she was richer than she really
was, or should it chance that having enjoyed her, he held her in less
esteem. If her price did not exceed three or four hundred crowns, he
would pay it gladly, because he had once had some regard for her."</p>
<p>"It must have been very little," said Leonisa, "since it was worth no
more than four hundred crowns. Ricardo was more generous. Heaven forgive
her who was the cause of his death, and that was myself; for I am the
unhappy maiden whom he wept as dead, and God knows how I should rejoice
were he alive, that I might repay him by letting him see how I felt for
his misfortunes. Yes, señor, I am the little loved of Cornello, the
truly wept of Ricardo, whom various chances have brought to the
miserable state in which I now am; but through all my perils, by the
favour of Heaven, I have preserved my honour unsullied, and that
consoles me in my misery. I know not at this moment where I am, nor who
is my master, nor what my adverse fates have determined is to become of
me. I entreat you, therefore, señor, by the Christian blood that flows
in your veins, that you will advise me in my difficulties; for though
they have already taught me something by experience, yet they are so
great and never-ending, that I know not what to do."</p>
<p>Mahmoud assured her he would do what he could to help her to the best of
his understanding and his power. He acquainted her with the nature of
the dispute there had been between the pashas concerning her, and how
she was now in the keeping of his master the cadi, who was to send her
to Constantinople to the Grand Turk Selim; but that he trusted that the
true God, in whom he, though a bad Christian, believed, would dispose of
her otherwise. He advised her to conciliate Halima, the wife of his
master the cadi, with whom she was to remain until she was sent to
Constantinople, and of whose character he gave her some details. Having
given her this and other useful counsel, he arrived at the cadi's house,
and delivered her over to Halima along with his master's message.</p>
<p>The Moorish woman received her well, seeing her so beautiful and so
handsomely dressed, and Mahmoud returned to the tents, where he
recounted to Ricardo, point by point, all that had passed between
himself and Leonisa; and the tears came into his eyes when he spoke of
the feeling displayed by Leonisa, when he told her that Ricardo was
dead. He stated how he had invented the story of Cornelio's captivity,
in order to see what impression it made on her; and in what disparaging
terms he had spoken of him. All this was balm to Ricardo's afflicted
heart.</p>
<p>"I remember, friend Mahmoud," he said, "an anecdote related to me by my
father; you know how ingenious he was, and you have heard how highly he
was honoured by the emperor, Charles V., whom he always served in
honourable posts in peace and war. He told me that when the emperor was
besieging Tunis, a Moorish woman was brought to him one day in his tent,
as a marvel of beauty, and that some rays of the sun, entering the tent,
fell upon her hair, which vied with them in its golden lustre; a rare
thing among the Moorish women, whoso hair is almost universally black.
Among many other Spanish gentlemen present on that occasion, there were
two of distinguished talent as poets, the one an Andalusian, the other a
Catalan. Struck with admiration at the sight before him, the Andalusian
began to extemporise some verses, but stopped short in the middle of the
last line, unable to finish them for want of a rhyme; whereupon the
Catalan, who saw his embarrassment, caught the line as it were out of
his mouth, finished it, continued the thought, and completed the poem.
This incident came into my mind when I saw the exquisitely beautiful
Leonisa enter the pasha's tent obscuring not only the rays of the sun,
but the whole firmament with all its stars."</p>
<p>"Gently, gently, friend Ricardo," said Mahmoud; "I am afraid if you
praise your mistress at that rate you will seem to be a heathen rather
than a Christian."</p>
<p>"Well, tell me then," said Ricardo, "what you think of doing in our
business. Whilst you were conducting Leonisa to Halima, a Venetian
renegade who was in the pasha's tent, and who understands Turkish very
well, explained to me all that had passed between them. Above all
things, then, we must try to find some means of preventing Leonisa's
being sent to the Grand Signor."</p>
<p>"The first thing to be done is to have you transferred to my master,"
said Mahmoud, "and then we will consider what next."</p>
<p>The keeper of Hassan's Christian slaves now came up and took Ricardo
away with him. The cadi returned to the city with Hassan, who in a few
days made out the report on Ali's administration, and gave it to him
under seal that he might depart to Constantinople. Ali went away at
once, laying strict injunctions on the cadi to send the captive without
delay to the sultan, along with such a letter as would be serviceable to
himself. The cadi promised all this with a treacherous heart, for it was
inflamed for the fair Christian. Ali went away full of false hopes,
leaving Hassan equally deluded by them. Mahmoud contrived that Ricardo
should pass into the possession of his master; but day after day stole
on, and Ricardo was so racked with longing to see Leonisa, that he could
have no rest. He changed his name to Mario, that his own might not reach
her ears before he saw her, which, indeed, was a very difficult thing,
because the Moors are exceedingly jealous, and conceal the faces of
their women from the eyes of all men; it is true they are not so
scrupulous with regard to Christian slaves, perhaps, because being
slaves they do not regard them as men.</p>
<p>Now it chanced that one day the lady Halima saw her slave Mario, and
gazed so much upon him that his image regained printed on her heart. Not
very well satisfied with the languid embraces of her old husband, she
readily gave admission to a reprehensible desire, and as readily
communicated it to Leonisa, whom she liked much for her agreeable
temper, and treated with great respect as a slave of the Grand Signor.
She told her how the cadi had brought home a Christian captive of such
graceful manners and appearance, that she had never set eyes on a more
engaging man in all her life; she understood that he was a chilidi (that
is, a gentleman) of the same country as her renegade Mahmoud, and she
knew not how to make known to him her inclination, so that the Christian
might not despise her for her voluntary declaration. Leonisa asked what
was the captive's name, and being told that it was Mario, she replied,
"If he was a gentleman, and of the place they say, I should know him;
but there is no one of that name in Trapani. But let me see him, and
speak with him, lady, and I will tell you who he is, and what may be
expected of him."</p>
<p>"It shall be so," said Halima. "On Friday, when the cadi is at prayers
in the mosque, I will make Mario come in here where you may speak to him
alone, and if you can give him a hint of my desires you will do so in
the best way you can."</p>
<p>Not two hours after this conversation the cadi sent for Mahmoud and
Mario, and with no less earnestness than Halima had unbosomed herself to
Leonisa, the amorous graybeard opened his own to his two slaves, asking
their advice as to what he should do to enjoy the Christian and cheat
the Grand Signor, to whom she belonged, for he would sooner die a
thousand deaths, than give her up to him. So earnestly did the reverend
Turk declare his passion that he inspired his two slaves with no less
earnestness, though their purposes were quite the reverse of his. It was
settled between them that Mario, as a countryman of the fair
Christian's, should take it in hand to solicit her on the cadi's part;
and that if that failed, the latter should use force, since she was in
his power, and afterwards account for not sending her to Constantinople
by pretending that she was dead. The cadi was highly delighted with the
advice of his two slaves, and with all imaginable alacrity he gave
Mahmoud his freedom on the spot, and promised to bequeath him half his
property when he died. To Mario likewise he promised, in case of success
his liberty and money enough to enable him to return home a wealthy man.</p>
<p>If he was liberal in promises, his slaves were prodigal; they would
bring down the moon to him from Heaven, much more Leonisa, if only he
gave them an opportunity of speaking with her. "Mario shall have one
whenever he pleases," said the cadi, "for I will make Halima go for some
days to the house of her parents, who are Greek Christians, and when she
is away I will order the porter to admit Mario into the house as often
as he pleases, and I will tell Leonisa that she may converse with her
countryman whenever she has a mind." Thus did the wind begin to shift in
Ricardo's favour, his master and mistress working for him without
knowing it; and the first who began was Halima, as was to be expected of
her, for it is the nature of women ever to be prompt and bold where
their pleasures are concerned.</p>
<p>That same day the cadi told Halima that she might pay a visit to her
parents, and stay with them some time if she liked; but elated as she
was with the false hopes given her by Leonisa, she was so far from
wishing to visit her parents, that she would not have cared to go to the
imaginary paradise of Mahomet. She replied then that she had no such
wish at that moment; when she had she would mention it, and then she
would take the Christian maiden with her. "That you must not," replied
the cadi, "for it is not right that the Grand Signor's slave should be
seen by any one, much less should she converse with Christians; for you
know that when she comes into the Sultan's possession she will be shut
up in the seraglio, and must become a Turk whether she will or not."</p>
<p>"As she will be in my company," said Halima, "there will be no harm in
her being in the house of my parents, or conversing with them. I do so
myself, and I am not less a good Turk for all that. Besides, I do not
intend to remain with them more than four or five days at most, for my
love for you will not allow me to be so long without seeing you." Here
the conversation dropped, the cadi not venturing to make any further
objection, for fear of rousing her suspicions.</p>
<p>Friday being come, he went to the mosque, from which he was sure not to
return for about four hours. He was no sooner gone than Halima sent for
Mario; but a Corsican slave who acted as porter, would not have admitted
him into the court-yard if Halima had not called out to let him pass,
whereupon he came in confused and trembling as if he were going to
encounter a host of enemies. Leonisa was seated at the foot of a great
marble staircase, in the dress in which she had appeared before the
pashas. Her right arm resting on her knee supported her head, and her
back was towards the door by which Mario entered, so that though he
advanced to where she sat, she did not see him.</p>
<p>Ricardo cast his eyes all round the place when he entered; all was
silence and solitude till he turned his gaze to where Leonisa sat.
Instantly he was seized with a thousand conflicting emotions. He was
within twenty paces of the object of his soul's desire; but he was a
captive, and the glory of his life was in the power of another. Thus
agitated with fear and exultation, joy and sadness, he advanced towards
her slowly, until Leonisa suddenly turned round and her eyes met his
earnest gaze. He stopped, unable to move another step. Leonisa, who
believed him to be dead, was struck with awe and consternation at seeing
him so unexpectedly before her. With her eyes still fixed upon him and
without turning her back, she retreated up four or five stairs, took a
little cross from her breast, kissed it again and again, and crossed
herself repeatedly, as though a being from the other world stood before
her. Ricardo presently recovered himself, and perceiving from Leonisa's
gestures what was the cause of her terror, he said, "It grieves me,
beautiful Leonisa, that the news which Mahmoud gave you of my death was
not true, so that I might be free from the fear I now feel lest the
rigour you have also shown towards me still subsists entire. Set your
mind at ease, lady, and come down; and if you will do what you have
never yet done—approach me—you will see that I am not a phantom. I am
Ricardo, Leonisa,—Ricardo the happy, if you will bid him be so."</p>
<p>Here Leonisa put her finger to her lips, giving Ricardo to understand
that he should be silent or speak more low. Gathering a little courage,
he drew near enough to hear her whisper thus: "Speak softly, Mario (for
so I hear you are now called): talk of nothing but what I talk of, and
bear in mind that if we are overheard it will be the cause of our never
meeting again. I believe that Halima, our mistress, is listening to us:
she has told me that she adores you, and has sent me here as her
intercessor. If you will respond to her desires, you will consult the
interest of your body more than of your soul; and if you will not, you
must feign to do so, were it only because I request it, and for sake of
what is due to the declared desires of a woman."</p>
<p>"Never did I think, never could I imagine, beauteous Leonisa," replied
Ricardo, "that you could ever ask anything of me with which I should
find it impossible to comply; but this present request of yours has
undeceived me. Is the inclination so slight a thing that it can be moved
this way or that at pleasure? Or would it become a man of truth and
honour to feign in matters of such weight? If you think that such things
can or ought to be done, be it as you will, since it is for you to
command and for me to obey; and that it may not be said I failed to do
so with regard to the first order you laid upon me, I will impose
silence on the voice of my honour, and will pretend to return Halima's
passion, as you desire, if I may thereby secure the blessing of seeing
you; and you have only to signify as much to her in such terms as you
shall think proper. In return for this sacrifice, to me the greatest
possible, I entreat you to tell me briefly how you escaped from the
hands of the corsairs, and fell into those of the Jew who sold you."</p>
<p>"The recital of my misfortunes," Leonisa answered, "demands more time
than we have now at our disposal; nevertheless, I will tell you some
particulars. The day after we parted company, Yusuf's galley was driven
back by a contrary wind to the island of Pantanalea, where we also saw
your galley, but ours, in spite of all efforts, was driven upon the
rocks. My master, seeing death so near, quickly emptied two water-casks,
closed them tightly, lashed them together with ropes, and placed me
between them. Then stripping off his clothes he took another cask in his
arms, and passing round his body a rope attached to the casks on which I
was placed, he boldly plunged into the sea. I had not the courage to
follow his example, but another Turk pushed me in. I fell senseless into
the water, and did not recover until I found myself on land, in the arms
of two Turks, who held me with my mouth downwards, discharging a great
quantity of water which I had swallowed. I opened my eyes, and looking
wildly round me, the first thing I saw was Yusuf lying beside me with
his skull shattered, having, as I afterwards learned, been dashed head
foremost against the rocks.</p>
<p>"The Turks told me that they had hawled me ashore by the rope, more dead
than alive. Only eight persons escaped out of the unfortunate galley. We
remained eight days on the island, during which the Turks treated me
with as much respect as if I were their sister. We lay hid in a cave,
the Turks being afraid of being captured by some of the Christian
garrison of a fort in the island, and we supported ourselves with
biscuits from the foundered galley which the waves cast ashore, and
which the men collected by night. It happened for my misfortune that the
commandant of the fort had died a few days before, and that there were
in it only twenty soldiers; this fact we learned from a boy whom the
Turks captured as he was amusing himself gathering shells on the shore.
At the end of eight days a Moorish vessel, of the kind which the Turks
call <i>caramuzal</i>, hove in sight; the Turks quitted their hiding-place,
and made signals which were recognised by the crew of the caramuzal.
They landed, and hearing from their countrymen an account of their
disasters, they took us all on board, where there was a very rich Jew,
to whom the whole cargo, or the greater part of it, belonged, consisting
of carpets, stuffs, and other wares, which are commonly exported by the
Jews from Barbary to the Levant. The vessel carried us to Tripoli, and
during the voyage I was sold to the Jew, who gave two thousand
doubloons, an excessive price; but the Jew was made liberal by the love
he conceived for me.</p>
<p>"After leaving the Turks in Tripoli, the vessel continued its voyage,
and the Jew began to importune me with his solicitations, which I
treated with the scorn they deserved. Despairing, therefore, of success,
he resolved to get rid of me upon the first opportunity; and knowing
that the two pashas, Ali and Hassan, were in this island, where he could
sell his goods as well as in Scio, whither he had been bound, he landed
here in hopes of disposing of me to one of the two pashas, with which
view he had me dressed as you now see me. I find that I have been
purchased by the cadi, for the purpose of being presented to the Grand
Turk, which causes me no little dread. Here I heard of your pretended
death, which, if you will believe me, grieved me to the soul; yet I
envied rather than pitied you, not from ill will towards you, for, if
insensible to love, I am yet neither unfeeling nor ungrateful, but
because I believed that your sorrows were all at an end."</p>
<p>"You would be right, lady," said Ricardo, "were it not that death would
have robbed me of the bliss of seeing you again. The felicity of this
moment is more to me than any blessing that life or death could bring
me, that of eternity alone excepted. My master, the cadi, into whose
hands I have fallen by as strange a series of adventures as your own, is
just in the same disposition towards you as Halima is towards me, and
has deputed me to be the interpreter of his feelings. I accepted the
office, not with the intention of serving his wishes, but my own in
obtaining opportunities to speak with you. Only see, Leonisa, to what a
pass our misfortunes have brought us; you to ask from me what you know
to be impossible; and me to propose to you what I would give my life not
to obtain, dear as that life is to me now, since I have the happiness to
behold you."</p>
<p>"I know not what to say to you, Ricardo," replied Leonisa, "nor what
issue we can find from the labyrinth in which we are involved. I can
only say that we must practise, what would not be expected from us,
dissimulation and deceit. I will repeat to Halima some phrases on your
part which will rather encourage than make her despair; and you may tell
the cadi whatever you think may serve, with safety to my honour, to keep
him in his delusion. And since I place my honour in your hands, you may
be assured that I have preserved it intact, in spite of all the perils
and trials I have undergone. Opportunity to converse together will be
easily afforded us, and to me this will be most pleasing, provided you
never address me on the subject of your suit; from the moment you do so,
I shall cease to see you; for I would not have you suppose that my
spirit is so weak as to be swayed by captivity. With the favour of
heaven, I hope to prove like gold which becomes the purer the more it is
passed through the furnace. Be content with the assurance I have given
you, that I shall no longer look upon you with repugnance, as I used to
do; for I must tell you, Ricardo, that I always found you somewhat more
arrogant and presumptuous than became you. I confess, also, that I was
deceived, and that my eyes being now opened, if the experiment were to
be made over again, perhaps I should be more humane to you, within the
bounds of honour. Go now, and God be with you; for I am afraid lest
Halima may have been listening to us, and she understands something of
our language."</p>
<p>"I fully acknowledge the propriety of all you have said, lady," replied
Ricardo. "I am infinitely obliged for the explanation you have given me,
and perhaps time will show you how profoundly respectful is the
adoration I profess for you. Rely upon me that I will deal in the best
manner with the cadi, and do you do the same with Halima. Believe me,
lady, since I have seen you, there has sprung up in my heart an assured
hope that we shall soon achieve our freedom; and so I commend you to
God's keeping, deferring to another time to tell you the events by which
fortune brought me to this place, after we were parted."</p>
<p>They now separated, Leonisa well pleased with Ricardo's modest
behaviour, and he overjoyed at having heard from her lips words unmixed
with harshness. Halima, meanwhile, had shut herself up in her room, and
was praying to Mahomet for Leonisa's success in the commission she had
given her. The cadi was in the mosque, burning, like his wife, with
desire, and anxiously awaiting the answer to be brought him by the slave
he had sent to speak to Leonisa, and whom Mahmoud was to admit to her
presence for that purpose, even though Halima was at home. Leonisa
inflamed Halima's impure desires, giving her very good hopes that Mario
would do all she wished, but telling her that two months must elapse
before he could consent to what he longed for even more than herself;
and that he asked that delay that he might complete a course of devotion
for the recovery of his freedom. Halima was satisfied with this excuse,
but begged Leonisa to tell her dear Mario to spare himself the trouble
and her the delay he proposed, for she would give him, at once, whatever
the cadi required for his ransom.</p>
<p>Before Ricardo went with his answer to his master, he consulted Mahmoud
as to what it should be. They agreed between them that it should be as
discouraging as possible, and that he should advise the cadi to take
the girl as soon as possible to Constantinople, and accomplish his
wishes on the way by fair means or by force. Moreover, that in order to
prevent the unpleasant consequences that might ensue from supplanting
the sultan, it would be well to purchase another slave, then pretend, or
contrive on the voyage, that Leonisa should fall sick, and throw the
newly-purchased Christian woman into the sea by night, with all possible
secrecy, giving out that the person who had died was Leonisa, the
sultan's slave. All this might be done in such a manner that the truth
should never be known, and the cadi would remain blameless in the
sultan's eyes, and have the full enjoyment of his desires. The wretched
old cadi, who was so blinded by his passion that he would have listened
to any absurdity they proposed, eagerly fell in with this scheme as one
full of promise; and so indeed it was, but not as he imagined; for the
intention of his two advisers was to make off with the boat, and pitch
the old fool into the sea.</p>
<p>But a difficulty occurred to the cadi, one of the greatest in his eyes
that could possibly be. It occurred to him that his wife would not let
him go to Constantinople without her; but presently he got over this
obstacle by saying, that instead of buying a Christian woman to put to
death in Leonisa's name, he would make Halima serve his turn, for he
longed with all his heart to be rid of her. Mahmoud and Ricardo agreed
to this expedient as readily as he proposed it, and this being finally
settled, the cadi that same day imparted to his wife his design of
setting out at once for Constantinople, to present the Christian captive
to the Sultan, who, he expected would, in his munificence, make him
grand cadi of Cairo or Constantinople. Halima, with great alacrity,
expressed her approval of his intention, believing that Mario would be
left at home; but when the cadi told her that he would take both him and
Mahmoud along with him, she changed her mind, and began to dissuade him
from what she had before advised; and finally, she told him that unless
she went with him she would not allow him to go at all. The cadi had
great satisfaction in complying with her desire, for he thought he would
soon get rid of a burden that hung like a millstone round his neck.</p>
<p>All this while Hassan Pasha was indefatigable in pressing the cadi to
give up the slave girl to him, in return for which he offered him
mountains of gold, and had already made him a present of Ricardo, whose
ransom he valued at two thousand crowns. Moreover, to facilitate the
transfer, he suggested to the cadi the same expedient which the latter
had himself devised, namely, that when the Grand Turk sent for Leonisa
he should pretend she was dead. But all the pasha's gifts, promises, and
entreaties, had no other effect on the cadi than to increase his
eagerness to hasten his departure. Tormented therefore by his own
desires, by Hassan's importunities, and by those of Halima (for she,
too, was amusing herself with vain hopes) he made such despatch that in
twenty days he had equipped a brigantine of fifteen benches, which he
manned with able Turkish mariners and some Greek Christians. He put all
his wealth on board it; Halima, too, left nothing of value behind her,
and asked her husband to let her take her parents with her that they
might see Constantinople. Halima entertained the same designs as Mahmoud
and Ricardo; she intended, with their help, to seize the brigantine, but
would not make this known to them until she found herself actually
embarked. Afterwards she proposed to land among Christians, return to
her old creed, and marry Ricardo; for she had reason to suppose that
bringing so much wealth with her, he would not fail to take her to wife
on her again becoming a Christian.</p>
<p>Ricardo had another interview with Leonisa, and made known to her the
whole scheme they had projected; and she in return apprised him of the
designs of Halima, who kept no secret from Leonisa. After mutual
injunctions of secrecy, they bade each other adieu until the day of
embarkation. When it arrived, Hassan escorted the party to the shore
with all his soldiers, and did not leave them until they had set sail.
Even then he never took his eyes off the brigantine until it was out of
sight. It almost seemed as if the sighs heaved by the enamoured
mussulman swelled the gale, and impelled with more force the sails that
were wafting away his soul. But as love had allowed him no rest, but
plenty of time to consider what he should do to escape being killed by
the vehemence of his unsatisfied desire, he immediately put in operation
a plan he had long matured. He put fifty soldiers, all trusty men, bound
to him by many favours received and expected, on board a vessel of
seventeen benches, which he had secretly fitted out in another port;
and he ordered them to pursue and capture the brigantine with all its
wealth, and put every soul on board to the sword, with the exception of
Leonisa, whom he desired to have as his own sole share of the immense
booty. He also ordered them to sink the brigantine, so that no trace of
her fate might remain.</p>
<p>Animated with the hope of plunder the soldiers proceeded with the utmost
alacrity to execute the pasha's orders, which seemed the more easy as
the crew of the brigantine were unarmed, not anticipating any such
encounter. It had been now two days under sail, which seemed two
centuries to the cadi, who would fain, on the very first of them, have
carried his design into effect. But his two slaves represented to him
the absolute necessity that Leonisa should first fall sick in order to
give colour to the report of her death, and that the feigned malady
ought to last some days. The cadi was much more disposed to say that she
died suddenly, finish the whole job at once, despatch his wife, and
allay the raging fire that was consuming his vitals; but he was obliged
to submit to the advice of his two counsellors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Halima had declared her design to Mahmoud and Ricardo, who
had signified their readiness to accomplish it when passing the Crosses
of Alexandria, or entering the castles of Anatolia; but so intolerably
did the cadi importune them, that they made up their minds to do so upon
the first opportunity that offered. After they had been six days at sea
the cadi thought that Leonisa's feigned malady had lasted quite long
enough, and was very urgent with them that they should finish with
Halima on the following day, and to quiet him they promised that they
would do so. But when that day came, which, as they expected, was to
witness the accomplishment of their own secret plans, or to be the last
of their lives, they suddenly discovered a vessel giving chase to them,
with all speed of sails and oars. They were afraid it was a Christian
corsair, from which neither party had any good to expect; for if it were
one, the mussulmans would be made captive, and the Christians, though
left at liberty, would be plundered of everything. Mahmoud and Ricardo,
however, took comfort in the prospect of freedom for Leonisa and
themselves; nevertheless, they were not without fear of the insolence of
the corsairs, for people who abandon themselves to such practices,
whatever be their religion or law, are invariably cruel and brutal. The
cadi's crew made preparation to defend themselves; but without quitting
their oars, and still doing all in their power to escape; but the vessel
in chase gained upon them so fast that in less than two hours it was
within cannon-shot. Seeing her so close, they lowered their sails, stood
to their arms, and awaited the assault, though the cadi told them they
had nothing to fear, for the stranger was under Turkish colours and
would do them no harm. He then gave orders to hoist the white flag of
peace.</p>
<p>Just then Mahmoud chanced to turn his head, and espied another galley of
some twenty benches apparently, bearing down upon them from the west. He
told the cadi, and some Christians at the oar said that this was a
vessel of their own people. The confusion and alarm was now doubled, and
all awaited the issue in anxious suspense, not knowing whether to hope
or fear it. I fancy the cadi, just then, would have gladly foregone all
his amorous hopes to be safe again in Nicosia, so great was his
perplexity. It did not last long however; for the first galley, without
paying the least regard to the flag of peace, or to what was due to a
community in religion, bore down upon his brigantine with such fury as
nearly to send it to the bottom. The cadi then perceived that the
assailants were soldiers of Nicosia, and guessing what was the real
state of the case, he gave himself up for lost; and had it not been for
the greed of the soldiers, who fell to plundering in the first instance,
not a soul would have been left alive. Suddenly, however, while they
were busy with all their might in pillaging, a voice cried out in
Turkish, "To arms! to arms! Here's a Christian galley bearing down upon
us!" And this indeed was true, for the galley which Mahmoud had descried
to the westward was bearing furiously down upon Hassan's under Christian
colours; but before it came to close quarters it hailed the latter.</p>
<p>"What galley is that?"</p>
<p>"Hassan Pasha's, viceroy of Cyprus."</p>
<p>"How comes it, then, that you, being mussulmans are plundering this
brigantine, on board of which, as we know, is the cadi of Nicosia?"</p>
<p>The reply to this was that they only knew that the pasha had ordered
them to take it, and that they, as his soldiers, had done his bidding.
The commander of the galley under Christian colours having now
ascertained what he wanted to know, desisted from attacking Hassan's and
fell upon the cadi's brigantine, killed ten of its Turkish crew at the
first volley, and immediately boarded it with great impetuosity. Then
the cadi discovered that his assailant was no Christian, but Ali Pasha,
Leonisa's lover, who had been laying wait to carry her off, and had
disguised himself and his soldiers as Christians, the better to conceal
his purpose.</p>
<p>The cadi, finding himself thus assailed on all sides, began loudly to
exert his lungs. "What means this, Ali Pasha, thou traitor?" he cried.
"How comes it that, being a mussulman, thou attackest me in the garb of
a Christian? And you, perfidious soldiers of Hassan, what demon has
moved you to commit so great an outrage? How dare you, to please the
lascivious appetite of him who sent you, set yourselves against your
sovereign?" At these words, the soldiers on both sides lowered their
arms, looked upon and recognised each other, for they had all served
under one captain and one flag. Confounded by the cadi's words, and by
their conscious criminality, they sheathed their blades, and seemed
quite discomfited. Ali alone shut his eyes and his ears to everything,
and rushing upon the cadi, dealt him such a stroke on the head with his
scimetar, that, but for the hundred ells of stuff that formed his
turban, he would certainly have cleft it in two. As it was, he knocked
the cadi down among the rower's benches, where he lay, exclaiming amid
his groans, "O cruel renegade! Enemy of the Prophet! Can it be that
there is no true mussulman left to avenge me? Accursed one! to lay
violent hands on thy cadi, on a minister of Mahomet!"</p>
<p>The cadi's denunciations made a strong impression on the minds of
Hassan's soldiers, who, fearing besides that Ali's men would despoil
them of the booty they already looked upon as their own, determined to
put all to the hazard of battle. Suddenly they fell upon Ali's men with
such vehemence that, although the latter were the stronger party, they
soon thinned their numbers considerably; the survivors, however, quickly
rallied, and so well avenged their slaughtered comrades, that barely
four of Hassan's men remained alive, and those too badly wounded.
Ricardo and Mahmoud, who had been watching the fight, putting their
heads out every now and then at the cabin hatchway, seeing now that most
of the Turks were dead, and the survivors all wounded, and that they
might very easily be mastered, called upon Halima's father and two of
his nephews to aid them in seizing the vessel. Then arming themselves
with the dead men's scimetars, they rushed amidships, shouting "Liberty!
Liberty!" and with the help of the stout Christian rowers, they soon
despatched all the Turks. Then they boarded Ali Pasha's galley. He had
been one of the first slain in the last conflict, a Turk having cut him
down in revenge for the cadi, and the galley being defenceless, they
took possession of it with all its stores.</p>
<p>By Ricardo's advice, all the valuables on board the brigantine and
Hassan's galley were transhipped to Ali's, that being the largest of the
three vessels, with plenty of stowage room, and a good sailer. The
rowers, too, were Christians, and being highly delighted with the
acquisition of their freedom, and with the gifts which Ricardo liberally
divided amongst them, they offered to carry him to Trapani, or to the
end of the world, if he desired it. After this, Mahmoud and Ricardo,
exulting in their success, went to Halima, and told her that if she
desired to return to Cyprus they would give her her own brigantine, with
its full complement of men, and half the wealth she had put on board it;
but as her affection for Ricardo was unabated, she replied that she
would rather go with them to Christian lands, whereat her parents were
exceedingly rejoiced.</p>
<p>The cadi having by this time got upon his legs again, he, too, had his
choice given him either to go into Christendom or return to Nicosia in
his own vessel. He replied that, "as fortune had reduced him to his
present situation, he thanked them for the boon of his liberty; and that
he desired to go to Constantinople to complain to the Grand Signor of
the outrage he had received at the hands of Ali and Hassan." But when he
heard that Halima was leaving him, and intended to go back to
Christianity, he was almost beside himself. Finally, they put him on
board his own vessel, supplying him abundantly with all accessories for
his voyage, and even giving him back some of his own sequins; and he
took leave of them all with the intention of returning to Nicosia; but
first he entreated that Leonisa would embrace him, declaring that if
she would graciously grant him that favour, it would wipe out the
recollection of all his misfortunes. All joined in entreating Leonisa to
grant him what he so earnestly desired, since she might do so without
prejudice to her honour. She complied, and the cadi besought her to lay
her hands on his head, that he might have hopes of his wound being
healed.</p>
<p>These adieux concluded, and having scuttled Hassan's galley, they sailed
away with a favouring breeze and soon lost sight of the brigantine, on
the deck of which stood the unlucky cadi, watching with swimming eyes
how the wind was wafting away his property, his delight, his wife, and
his whole soul. With very different feelings did Ricardo and Mahmoud
pursue their way. They passed in sight of Alexandria, and without
shortening sail, or needing to have recourse to their oars, they touched
at Corfu, where they took in water; and then without more delay they
left behind them the ill-famed Acroceraunian rocks, and descried afar
off Paquino, a promontory of the most fertile Trinacria, at sight of
which, and of the illustrious island of Malta, their prosperous barque
seemed to fly across the waters. In fine, fetching a compass round the
island, in four days afterwards they made Lampadosa, and then the island
where Leonisa had been shipwrecked, at sight of which she almost
swooned.</p>
<p>On the following day the beloved native land they so longed for
gladdened their eyes and their hearts. Their spirits rose tumultuously
with this new joy, one of the greatest that can be known in this life,
to return safe and sound to one's country after long captivity; and one
which may compare with it is that of victory achieved over its enemies.
There was in the galley a chest full of flags and streamers of various
colours, with which Ricardo had the rigging adorned. Soon after daybreak
they were within less than a league of the city, when taking to their
oars, and uttering every now and then joyous cries, they advanced to the
harbour, the shore of which was immediately lined by a great concourse
of people; for the gaily adorned galley had been so long in sight, that
the whole town had come down to observe it more closely.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ricardo had entreated Leonisa to dress herself just as she
had appeared in the tent before the two pashas, for he wished to play
off a pleasant trick upon his relations. She did so, adding jewels to
jewels, pearls to pearls, and beauty to beauty (for it increases with
the satisfaction of the heart), to the renewed admiration and
astonishment of all. Ricardo and Mahmoud also dressed themselves in the
Turkish costume, and made the crew put on the garments of the dead
Turks. It was about eight o'clock when they entered the harbour, and the
morning was so calm and clear that it seemed as though it were intent on
beholding this joyful arrival.</p>
<p>Before coming into port, Ricardo fired a salute with the three pieces
belonging to the galley, which were one gun amidships, and two
falconets; the town returned the salute with an equal number. The whole
shore was in lively commotion, watching the approach of the gaily decked
galley; but when they had a nearer view of it, and saw by the white
turbans of the pretended mussulmans that it was a Turkish craft, there
was a general alarm. Suspecting some stratagem, the people flew to arms,
all the soldiers in the town were marched down to the port, and the
cavalry scoured the coast. Highly amused at all this, the navigators
held on their course, entered the port, and anchored close to the shore.
Then running out a plank they all stepped ashore one after the other as
if in procession, and falling on their knees kissed the ground with
tears of joy—a clear proof to all who witnessed their proceedings that
they were no Turks. When all the crew were out of the vessel, Halima
with her father and mother, and her two nephews, followed next, all
dressed as Turks; and the beautiful Leonisa, her face covered with a
crimson veil, and escorted on either side by Mahmoud and Ricardo, closed
the procession, while the eyes of the whole multitude were fixed upon
her. They too did as the others had done, and knelt and kissed the
ground.</p>
<p>Presently the captain and governor of the city advanced towards them,
perceiving that they were the principal persons belonging to the vessel.
The moment he set eyes on Ricardo he recognised him, ran to him with
open arms, and embraced him with the liveliest demonstrations of joy.
With the governor came Cornelio and his father, Leonisa's parents and
relations, and those of Ricardo, all of whom were among the principal
persons in the city. Ricardo returned the governor's embrace and his
cordial greeting; held out his hand to Cornelio (who had changed colour
at sight of him, and almost quaked for fear), and, holding Leonisa also
by the hand, thus addressed the bystanders: "Under your favour,
gentlemen, I beg that, before we enter the city and the temple to return
the thanks so justly due to our Lord for the great mercies vouchsafed to
us in our distresses, that you will listen to a few words I have to say
to you." The governor bade him say on, for all present would listen to
him with pleasure and in silence. All the principal people then formed a
circle round him, and he addressed them as follows:—</p>
<p>"You must well remember, gentlemen, the misfortune which befel me some
mouths ago in the garden of the Salt Pits, and the loss of Leonisa: nor
can you have forgotten the exertions I made to procure her liberation,
since, regardless of my own, I offered all I was worth for her ransom.
But this seeming generosity is not to be imputed to me as a merit, since
I did but offer my fortune for the ransom of my soul. What has since
happened to us both requires more time to relate, a more convenient
season, and a speaker less agitated than myself. For the present, let it
suffice to tell you that after various extraordinary adventures, and
after a thousand disappointments of our hopes of relief, merciful Heaven
has, without any merit of ours, restored us to our beloved country, with
hearts full of joy and with abundance of wealth. It is not from this,
nor from the recovery of my freedom, that springs the incomparable
pleasure I now experience, but from that which I imagine this sweet
enemy of mine in peace and in war enjoys on seeing herself restored to
freedom and to her birth-place. Yet, I rejoice in the general joy of
those who have been my companions in misery; and though grievous
disasters are apt to alter the disposition and debase worthy minds, it
has not been so with the fair destroyer of my hopes, for with more
fortitude and invincibility than can well be told, she has passed
through the wrecking sea of her disasters and the encounters of my
ardent though honourable importunities.</p>
<p>"But to return to the point from which I set out: I offered my fortune
for her ransom, and with it the surrender of my soul's desires; I strove
for her liberation, and ventured more for her than for my own life. All
these things might seem to be obligations of some moment, but I will
not have them regarded in that light; what I would have so considered,
is that which I now do;" and so saying, he raised his hand and
respectfully withdrew the veil from Leonisa's face—it was like removing
a cloud from before the sun—and then he continued: "See, Cornelio; here
I present to you the prize which you should value above all precious
things on earth; and here, beauteous Leonisa, I present to you him whom
you have always borne in memory. This is what I would have you all
esteem as generosity, in comparison with which to give fortune, life,
and honour, is nothing.</p>
<p>"Take her, O fortunate youth, take her; and if your understanding can
reach the height of comprehending the greatness of her worth, esteem
yourself the most fortunate of mankind. With her I will also give you my
whole share of what Heaven has bestowed on us all; it will exceed, as I
fully believe, thirty thousand crowns. You may enjoy it all freely and
at your ease, and Heaven grant you to do so for many happy years. For my
hapless self, since I am left without Leonisa, it is my pleasure to be
poor. To want Leonisa, is to find life superfluous."</p>
<p>Here he ceased speaking, as if his tongue clove to the roof of his
mouth, but soon afterwards, before any one else had spoken, he
exclaimed, "Good heavens! how toil and trouble confuse the
understanding! In the eagerness of my desire to do right, I have spoken
inconsiderately, for no one can be generous in disposing of what is not
his own. What authority have I over Leonisa to give her to another? Or
how can I bestow what is so far from being mine? Leonisa is her own
mistress, and so much so, that failing her parents (long and happily may
they live), her wishes could have no opposition to encounter. Should
they meet an imaginary obstacle in the obligations which she, in her
good feeling, may think she is under to me, from this moment I cancel
them, and declare them null and void. I unsay, then, what I have said,
and I give Cornelio nothing, for I cannot; only I confirm the transfer
of my property made to Leonisa, without desiring any other recompense
than that she will believe in the sincerity of my honourable sentiments
towards her, and be assured that they never had an aim unbecoming her
incomparable virtue, her worth, and her infinite beauty."</p>
<p>Ricardo closed his speech with these words, and Leonisa thus replied,
"If you imagine, Ricardo, that I bestowed any favour on Cornelio during
the time when you were enamoured of me and jealous, think that it was in
all honour, as being done by the express desire of my parents, who
wished to have him for their son-in-law. If you are satisfied with this
explanation, I am sure you are no less so with what you have yourself
experienced as to my virtue and modesty. I say this, Ricardo, that you
may know that I have always been mistress of myself, and subject to no
one else except my parents, whom I now entreat humbly, as is meet, to
grant me leave and license to dispose of what your magnanimous
generosity has given me."</p>
<p>Her parents said she might do so, for they relied on her great
discretion that she would make such use of it as would always redound to
her honour and advantage. "With that permission, then," said Leonisa, "I
beg it may not be taken amiss if I choose rather to seem overbold than
ungrateful; and so, worthy Ricardo, my inclination, hitherto coy,
perplexed, and dubious, declares in your favour, that the world may know
that women are not all ungrateful. I am yours, Ricardo, and yours I will
be till death, unless better knowledge move you to refuse me your hand."</p>
<p>Ricardo was almost beside himself to hear her speak thus, and could make
no other reply than by falling on his knees before her, grasping her
hands, and kissing them a thousand times, with delicious tears. Cornelio
wept with vexation, Leonisa's parents for joy, and all the bystanders
for admiration and sympathy.</p>
<p>The bishop, who was present, led them with his blessing to the church,
and dispensing with the usual forms, married them at once. The whole
city overflowed with gladness, which it testified that night by a
splendid illumination, and for many days following in jousts and
rejoicings given by the relations of Ricardo and Leonisa. Halima, who
had lost all hope of having Ricardo for her husband, was content to
become the wife of Mahmoud, having returned with him to the bosom of the
church. Her parents and her two nephews were, by Ricardo's bounty,
presented with so much out of his share of the spoil as sufficed to
maintain them for the rest of their lives. In a word, all were happy to
their heart's content; and the fame of Ricardo, spreading beyond the
limits of Sicily, extended throughout all Italy and beyond it. He was
universally known as the Generous Lover, and his renown is still
prolonged in the persons of the many sons borne to him by Leonisa, who
was a rare example of discretion, virtue, modesty, and beauty.</p>
