<body class="x-ebookmaker x-ebookmaker-2"><p>"It is true that I am the person you say," replied Don Juan. "I have
never yet desired to conceal my name; but tell me, Signor, who you are
yourself, that I may not be surprised into any discourtesy."</p>
<p>"Discourtesy from you, Signor, would be impossible," rejoined the duke.
"I feel sure that you could not be discourteous in any case; but I
hasten to tell you, nevertheless, that I am the Duke of Ferrara, and a
man who will be bound to do you service all the days of his life, since
it is but a few nights since you gave him that life which must else have
been lost."</p>
<p>Alfonzo had not finished speaking, when Don Juan, springing lightly from
his horse, hastened to kiss the feet of the duke; but, with all his
agility, the latter was already out of the saddle, and alighted in the
arms of the Spaniard.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Signor Lorenzo, who could but observe these ceremonies from
a distance, believed that what he beheld was the effect of anger rather
than courtesy; he therefore put his horse to its speed, but pulled up
midway on perceiving that the duke and Don Juan were of a verity clasped
in each other's arms. It then chanced that Alfonso, looking over the
shoulders of Don Juan, perceived Lorenzo, whom he instantly recognised;
and somewhat disconcerted at his appearance, while still holding Don
Juan embraced, he inquired if Lorenzo Bentivoglio, whom he there beheld,
had come with him or not. Don Juan replied, "Let us move somewhat apart
from this place, and I will relate to your excellency some very singular
circumstances."</p>
<p>The duke having done as he was requested, Don Juan said to him, "My Lord
Duke, I must tell you that Lorenzo Bentivoglio, whom you there see, has
a cause of complaint against you, and not a light one; he avers that
some nights since you took his sister, the Lady Cornelia, from the house
of a lady, her cousin, and that you have deceived her, and dishonoured
his house; he desires therefore to know what satisfaction you propose to
make for this, that he may then see what it behoves him to do. He has
begged me to be his aid and mediator in the matter, and I have consented
with a good will, since, from certain indications which he gave me, I
perceived that the person of whom he complained, and yourself, to whose
liberal courtesy I owe this rich ornament, were one and the same. Thus,
seeing that none could more effectually mediate between you than myself,
I offered to undertake that office willingly, as I have said; and now I
would have you tell me, Signor, if you know aught of this matter, and
whether what Lorenzo has told me be true."</p>
<p>"Alas, my friend, it is so true," replied the duke, "that I durst not
deny it, even if I would. Yet I have not deceived or carried off
Cornelia, although I know that she has disappeared from the house of
which you speak. I have not deceived her, because I have taken her for
my wife; and I have not carried her off, since I do not know what has
become of her. If I have not publicly celebrated my nuptials with her,
it is because I waited until my mother, who is now at the last
extremity, should have passed to another life, she desiring greatly that
I should espouse the Signora Livia, daughter of the Duke of Mantua.
There are, besides, other reasons, even more important than this, but
which it is not convenient that I should now make known.</p>
<p>"What has in fact happened is this:—on the night when you came to my
assistance, I was to have taken Cornelia to Ferrara, she being then in
the last month of her pregnancy, and about to present me with that
pledge of our love with which it has pleased God to bless us; but
whether she was alarmed by our combat or by my delay, I know not; all I
can tell you is, that when I arrived at the house, I met the confidante
of our affection just coming out. From her I learned that her mistress
had that moment left the house, after having given birth to a son, the
most beautiful that ever had been seen, and whom she had given to one
Fabio, my servant. The woman is she whom you see here. Fabio is also in
this company; but of Cornelia and her child I can learn nothing. These
two days I have passed at Bologna, in ceaseless endeavours to discover
her, or to obtain some clue to her retreat, but I have not been able to
learn anything."</p>
<p>"In that case," interrupted Don Juan, "if Cornelia and her child were
now to appear, you would not refuse to admit that the first is your
wife, and the second your son?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not," replied the duke; "for if I value myself on being a
gentleman, still more highly do I prize the title of Christian.
Cornelia, besides, is one who well deserves to be mistress of a kingdom.
Let her but come, and whether my mother live or die, the world shall
know that I maintain my faith, and that my word, given in private, shall
be publicly redeemed."</p>
<p>"And what you have now said to me you are willing to repeat to your
brother, Signor Lorenzo?" inquired Don Juan.</p>
<p>"My only regret is," exclaimed the duke, "that he has not long before
been acquainted with the truth."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Don Juan made sign to Lorenzo that he should join them,
which he did, alighting from his horse and proceeding towards the place
where his friends stood, but far from hoping for the good news that
awaited him.</p>
<p>The duke advanced to receive him with open arms, and the first word he
uttered was to call him brother. Lorenzo scarcely knew how to reply to a
reception so courteous and a salutation so affectionate. He stood
amazed, and before he could utter a word, Don Juan said to him, "The
duke, Signor Lorenzo, is but too happy to admit his affection for your
sister, the Lady Cornelia; and, at the same time, he assures you, that
she is his legitimate consort. This, as he now says it to you, he will
affirm publicly before all the world, when the moment for doing so has
arrived. He confesses, moreover, that he did propose to remove her from
the house of her cousin some nights since, intending to take her to
Ferrara, there to await the proper time for their public espousals,
which he has only delayed for just causes, which he has declared to me.
He describes the conflict he had to maintain against yourself; and adds,
that when he went to seek Cornelia, he found only her waiting-woman,
Sulpicia, who is the woman you see yonder: from her he has learned that
her lady had just given birth to a son, whom she entrusted to a servant
of the duke, and then left the house in terror, because she feared that
you, Signor Lorenzo, had been made aware of her secret marriage: the
lady hoped, moreover, to find the duke awaiting her in the street. But
it seems that Sulpicia did not give the babe to Fabio, but to some other
person instead of him, and the child does not appear, neither is the
Lady Cornelia to be found, in spite of the duke's researches. He admits,
that all these things have happened by his fault; but declares, that
whenever your sister shall appear, he is ready to receive her as his
legitimate wife. Judge, then, Signor Lorenzo, if there be any more to
say or to desire beyond the discovery of those two dear but unfortunate
ones—the lady and her infant."</p>
<p>To this Lorenzo replied by throwing himself at the feet of the duke,
who raised him instantly. "From your greatness and Christian
uprightness, most noble lord and dear brother," said Lorenzo, "my sister
and I had certainly nothing less than this high honour to expect."
Saying this, tears came to his eyes, and the duke felt his own becoming
moist, for both were equally affected,—the one with the fear of having
lost his wife, the other by the generous candour of his brother-in-law;
but at once perceiving the weakness of thus displaying their feelings,
they both restrained themselves, and drove back those witnesses to their
source; while the eyes of Don Juan, shining with gladness, seemed almost
to demand from them the <i>albricias</i><a id="FNanchor_5_5"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-1.htm.html#Footnote_5_5" class="pginternal"><sup>[5]</sup></a> of good news, seeing that he
believed himself to have both Cornelia and her son in his own house.</p>
<p>Things were at this point when Don Antonio de Isunza, whom Don Juan
recognised at a considerable distance by his horse, was perceived
approaching. He also recognised Don Juan and Lorenzo, but not the duke,
and did not know what he was to do, or whether he ought to rejoin his
friend or not. He therefore inquired of the duke's servants who the
gentleman was, then standing with Lorenzo and Don Juan. They replied
that it was the Duke of Ferrara; and Don Antonio, knowing less than ever
what it was best for him to do, remained in some confusion, until he was
relieved from it by Don Juan, who called him by his name. Seeing that
all were on foot, Don Antonio also dismounted, and, approaching the
group, was received with infinite courtesy by the duke, to whom Don Juan
had already named him as his friend; finally, Don Antonio was made
acquainted with all that had taken place before his arrival.</p>
<p>Rejoicing greatly at what he heard, Don Antonio then said to his
comrade, "Why, Signor Don Juan, do you not finish your work, and raise
the joy of these Signors to its acmè, by requiring from them the
albricias for discovering the Lady Cornelia and her son?"</p>
<p>"Had you not arrived, I might have taken those albricias you speak of,"
replied Don Juan; "but now they are yours, Don Antonio, for I am certain
that the duke and Signor Lorenzo will give them to you most joyfully."</p>
<p>The duke and Lorenzo hearing of Cornelia being found, and of albricias,
inquired the meaning of those words.</p>
<p>"What can it be," replied Don Antonio, "if not that I also design to
become one of the personages in this happily terminating drama, being he
who is to demand the albricias for the discovery of the Lady Cornelia
and her son, who are both in my house." He then at once related to the
brothers, point by point, what has been already told, intelligence which
gave the duke and Lorenzo so much pleasure, that each embraced one of
the friends with all his heart, Lorenzo throwing himself into the arms
of Don Juan, and the duke into those of Don Antonio—the latter
promising his whole dukedom for albricias, and Lorenzo his life, soul,
and estates. They then called the woman who had given the child to Don
Juan, and she having perceived her master, Lorenzo Bentivoglio, came
forward, trembling. Being asked if she could recognise the man to whom
she had given the infant, she replied that she could not; but that when
she had asked if he were Fabio, he had answered "yes," and that she had
entrusted the babe to his care in the faith of that reply.</p>
<p>"All this is true," returned Don Juan; "and you furthermore bade me
deposit the child in a place of security, and instantly return."</p>
<p>"I did so," replied the waiting-woman, weeping. But the duke exclaimed,
"We will have no more tears; all is gladness and joy. I will not now
enter Ferrara, but return at once to Bologna; for this happiness is but
in shadow until made perfect by the sight of Cornelia herself." Then,
without more words, the whole company wheeled round, and took their way
to Bologna.</p>
<p>Don Antonio now rode forward to prepare the Lady Cornelia, lest the
sudden appearance of her brother and the duke might cause too violent a
revulsion; but not finding her as he expected, and the pages being
unable to give him any intelligence respecting her, he suddenly found
himself the saddest and most embarrassed man in the world. Learning that
the gouvernante had departed, he was not long in conjecturing that the
lady had disappeared by her means. The pages informed him that the
housekeeper had gone on the same day with himself and Don Juan, but as
to that Lady Cornelia, respecting whom he inquired, they had never seen
her. Don Antonio was almost out of his senses at this unexpected
occurrence, which, he feared, must make the duke consider himself and
Don Juan to be mere liars and boasters. He was plunged in these sad
thoughts when Alfonso entered with Lorenzo and Don Juan, who had spurred
on before the attendants by retired and unfrequented streets. They found
Don Antonio seated with his head on his hand, and as pale as a man who
has been long dead, and when Don Juan inquired what ailed him, and where
was the Lady Cornelia, he replied, "Rather ask me what do I not ail,
since the Lady Cornelia is not to be found. She quitted the house, on
the same day as ourselves, with the gouvernante we left to keep her
company."</p>
<p>This sad news seemed as though it would deprive the duke of life, and
Lorenzo of his senses. The whole party remained in the utmost
consternation and dismay; when one of the pages said to Don Antonio in a
whisper, "Signor, Santisteban, Signor Don Juan's page, has had locked up
in his chamber, from the day when your worships left, a very pretty
woman, whose name is certainly Cornelia, for I have heard him call her
so." Plunged into a new embarrassment, Don Antonio would rather not have
found the lady at all—for he could not but suppose it was she whom the
page had shut up in his room—than have discovered her in such a place.
Nevertheless, without saying a word, he ascended to the page's chamber,
but found the door fast, for the young man had gone out, and taken away
the key. Don Antonio therefore put his lips to the keyhole, and said in
a low voice, "Open the door, Signora Cornelia, and come down to receive
your brother, and the duke, your husband, who are waiting to take you
hence."</p>
<p>A voice from within replied, "Are you making fun of me? It is certain
that I am neither so ugly nor so old but that dukes and counts may very
well be looking for me: but this comes of condescending to visit pages."
These words quite satisfied Don Antonio that it was not the Lady
Cornelia who had replied.</p>
<p>At that moment Santisteban returned and went up to his chamber, where he
found Don Antonio, who had just commanded that all the keys of the
house should be brought, to see if any one of them would open the door.
The page fell on his knees, and held up the key, exclaiming, "Have mercy
on me, your worship: your absence, or rather my own villainy, made me
bring this woman to my room; but I entreat your grace, Don Antonio, as
you would have good news from Spain, that you suffer the fault I have
committed to remain unknown to my master, Don Juan, if he be not yet
informed of it; I will turn her out this instant."</p>
<p>"What is the name of this woman?" inquired Don Antonio. "Cornelia,"
replied Santisteban. Down stairs at once went the page who had
discovered the hidden woman, and who was not much of a friend to
Santisteban, and entered the room where sat the duke, Don Juan, and
Lorenzo, and, either from simplicity or malice, began to talk to
himself, saying, "Well caught, brother page! by Heaven they have made
you give up your Lady Cornelia! She was well hidden, to be sure; and no
doubt my gentleman would have liked to see the masters remain away that
he might enjoy himself some three or four days longer."</p>
<p>"What is that you are saying?" cried Lorenzo, who had caught a part of
these words. "Where is the Lady Cornelia?" "She is above," replied the
page; and the duke, who supposed that his consort had just made her
appearance, had scarcely heard the words before he rushed from the
apartment like a flash of lightning, and, ascending the staircase at a
bound, gained the chamber into which Don Antonio was entering.</p>
<p>"Where is Cornelia? where is the life of my life?" he exclaimed, as he
hurried into the room.</p>
<p>"Cornelia is here," replied a woman who was wrapped in a quilt taken
from the bed with which she had concealed her face. "Lord bless us!" she
continued, "one would think an ox had been stolen! Is it a new thing for
a woman to visit a page, that you make such a fuss about it?"</p>
<p>Lorenzo, who had now entered the room, angrily snatched off the sheet
and exposed to view a woman still young and not ill-looking, who hid her
face in her hands for shame, while her dress, which served her instead
of a pillow, sufficiently proved her to be some poor castaway.</p>
<p>The duke asked her, was it true her name was Cornelia? It was, she
replied—adding, that she had very decent parents in the city, but that
no one could venture to say, "Of this water I will never drink."</p>
<p>The duke was so confounded by all he beheld, that he was almost inclined
to think the Spaniards were making a fool of him; but, not to encourage
so grievous a suspicion, he turned away without saying a word. Lorenzo
followed him; they mounted their horses and rode off, leaving Don Juan
and Don Antonio even more astonished and dismayed than himself.</p>
<p>The two friends now determined to leave no means untried, possible or
impossible, to discover the retreat of the Lady Cornelia, and convince
the duke of their sincerity and uprightness. They dismissed Santisteban
for his misconduct, and turned the worthless Cornelia out of the house.
Don Juan then remembered that they had neglected to describe to the duke
those rich jewels wherein Cornelia carried her relics, with the agnus
she had offered to them; and they went out proposing to mention that
circumstance, so as to prove to Alfonso that the lady had, indeed, been
in their care, and that if she had now disappeared, it was not by any
fault of theirs.</p>
<p>They expected to find the duke in Lorenzo's house; but the latter
informed them that Alfonso had been compelled to leave Bologna, and had
returned to Ferrara, having committed the search for Cornelia to his
care. The friends having told him what had brought them, Lorenzo assured
them that the duke was perfectly convinced of their rectitude in the
matter, adding, that they both attributed the flight of Cornelia to her
great fear, but hoped, and did not doubt, that Heaven would permit her
re-appearance before long, since it was certain that the earth had not
swallowed the housekeeper, the child, and herself.</p>
<p>With these considerations they all consoled themselves, determining not
to make search by any public announcement, but secretly, since, with the
exception of her cousin, no person was yet acquainted with the
disappearance of Cornelia; and Lorenzo judged that a public search might
prove injurious to his sister's name among such as did not know the
whole circumstances of the case, since the labour of effacing such
suspicions as might arise would be infinite, and by no means certain of
success.</p>
<p>The duke meanwhile continued his journey to Ferrara, and favouring
Fortune, which was now preparing his happiness, led him to the village
where dwelt that priest in whose house Cornelia, her infant, and the
housekeeper, were concealed. The good Father was acquainted with the
whole history, and Cornelia had begged his advice as to what it would be
best for her to do. Now this priest had been the preceptor of the duke;
and to his dwelling, which was furnished in a manner befitting that of a
rich and learned clerk, the duke was in the habit of occasionally
repairing from Ferrara, and would thence go to the chase, or amuse
himself with the pleasant conversation of his host, and with the
knowledge and excellence of which the good priest gave evidence in all
he did or said.</p>
<p>The priest was not surprised to receive a visit from the duke, because,
as we have said, it was not the first by many; but he was grieved to see
him sad and dejected, and instantly perceived that his whole soul was
absorbed in some painful thought. As to Cornelia, having been told that
the duke was there, she was seized with renewed terror, not knowing how
her misfortunes were to terminate. She wrung her hands, and hurried from
one side of her apartment to the other, like a person who had lost her
senses. Fain would the troubled lady have spoken to the priest, but he
was in conversation with the Duke, and could not be approached. Alfonso
was meanwhile saying to him, "I come to you, my father, full of sadness,
and will not go to Ferrara to-day, but remain your guest; give orders
for all my attendants to proceed to the city, and let none remain with
me but Fabio."</p>
<p>The priest went to give directions accordingly, as also to see that his
own servants made due preparations; and Cornelia then found an
opportunity for speaking to him. She took his two hands and said, "Ah,
my father, and dear sir, what has the duke come for? for the love of God
see what can be done to save me! I pray you, seek to discover what he
proposes. As a friend, do for me whatever shall seem best to your
prudence and great wisdom."</p>
<p>The priest replied, "Duke Alfonso has come to me in deep sadness, but
up to this moment he has not told me the cause. What I would have you
now do is to dress this infant with great care, put on it all the jewels
you have with you, more especially such as you may have received from
the duke himself; leave the rest to me, and I have hope that Heaven is
about to grant us a happy day." Cornelia embraced the good man, and
kissed his hand, and then retired to dress and adorn the babe, as he had
desired.</p>
<p>The priest, meanwhile, returned to entertain the duke with conversation
while his people were preparing their meal; and in the course of their
colloquy he inquired if he might venture to ask him the cause of his
grief, since it was easy to see at the distance of a league that,
something gave him sorrow.</p>
<p>"Father," replied the duke, "it is true that the sadness of the heart
rises to the face, and in the eyes may be read the history of that which
passes in the soul; but for the present I cannot confide the cause of my
sorrow to any one."</p>
<p>"Then we will not speak of it further, my lord duke," replied the
priest; "but if you were in a condition permitting you to examine a
curious and beautiful thing, I have one to show you which I cannot but
think would afford you great pleasure."</p>
<p>"He would be very unwise," returned Alfonso, "who, when offered a solace
for his suffering, refuses to accept it. Wherefore show me what you
speak of, father; the object is doubtless an addition to one of your
curious collections, and they have all great interest in my eyes."</p>
<p>The priest then rose, and repaired to the apartment where Cornelia was
awaiting him with her son, whom she had adorned as he had suggested,
having placed on him the relics and agnus, with other rich jewels, all
gifts of the duke to the babe's mother. Taking the infant from her
hands, the good priest then went to the duke, and telling him that he
must rise and come to the light of the window, he transferred the babe
from his own arms into those of Alfonso, who could not but instantly
remark the jewels; and perceiving that they were those which he had
himself given to Cornelia, he remained in great surprise. Looking
earnestly at the infant, meanwhile, he fancied he beheld his own
portrait; and full of admiration, he asked the priest to whom the child
belonged, remarking, that from its decorations and appearance one might
take it to be the son of some princess.</p>
<p>"I do not know," replied the priest, "to whom it belongs; all I can tell
you is, that it was brought to me some nights since by a cavalier of
Bologna, who charged me to take good care of the babe and bring it up
heedfully, since it was the son of a noble and valiant father, and of a
mother highly born as well as beautiful. With the cavalier there came
also a woman to suckle the infant, and of her I have inquired if she
knew anything of the parents, but she tells me that she knows nothing
whatever; yet of a truth, if the mother possess but half the beauty of
the nurse, she must be the most lovely woman in Italy."</p>
<p>"Could I not see her?" asked the Duke. "Yes, certainly you may see her,"
returned the priest. "You have only to come with me; and if the beauty
and decorations of the child surprise you, I think the sight of the
nurse cannot fail to produce an equal effect."</p>
<p>The priest would then have taken the infant from the duke, but Alfonso
would not let it go; he pressed it in his arms, and gave it repeated
kisses; the good father, meanwhile, hastened forward, and bade Cornelia
approach to receive the duke. The lady obeyed; her emotion giving so
rich a colour to her face that the beauty she displayed seemed something
more than human. The duke, on seeing her, remained as if struck by a
thunderbolt, while she, throwing herself at his feet, sought to kiss
them. The duke said not a word, but gave the infant to the priest, and
hurried out of the apartment.</p>
<p>Shocked at this, Cornelia said to the priest, "Alas, dear father, have I
terrified the duke with the sight of my face? am I become hateful to
him? Has he forgot the ties by which he has bound himself to me? Will he
not speak one word to me? Was his child such a burden to him that he has
thus rejected him from his arm's?"</p>
<p>To all these questions the good priest could give no reply, for he too
was utterly confounded by the duke's hasty departure, which seemed more
like a flight than anything else.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Alfonso had but gone out to summon Fabio. "Ride Fabio, my
friend," he cried, "ride for your life to Bologna, and tell Lorenzo
Bentivoglio that he must come with all speed to this place; let him
make no excuse, and bid him bring with him the two Spanish gentlemen,
Don Juan de Gamboa and Don Antonio de Isunza. Return instantly, Fabio,
but not without them, for it concerns my life to see them here."</p>
<p>Fabio required no further pressing, but instantly carried his master's
commands into effect. The duke returned at once to Cornelia, caught her
in his arms, mingled his tears with hers, and kissed her a thousand
times; and long did the fond pair remain thus silently locked in each
other's embrace, both speechless from excess of joy. The nurse of the
infant and the dame, who proclaimed herself a Crivella, beheld all this
from the door of the adjoining apartment, and fell into such ecstasies
of delight that they knocked their heads against the wall, and seemed
all at once to have gone out of their wits. The priest bestowed a
thousand kisses on the infant, whom he held on one arm, while with his
right hand he showered no end of benedictions on the noble pair. At
length his reverence's housekeeper, who had been occupied with her
culinary preparations, and knew nothing of what had occurred, entered to
notify to her master that dinner was on the table, and so put an end to
this scene of rapture.</p>
<p>The duke then took his babe from the arms of the priest, and kept it in
his own during the repast, which was more remarkable for neatness and
good taste than for splendour. While they were at table, Cornelia
related to the duke all that had occurred until she had taken refuge
with the priest, by the advice of the housekeeper of those two Spanish
gentlemen, who had protected and guarded her with such assiduous and
respectful kindness. In return the duke related to her all that had
befallen himself during the same interval; and the two housekeepers, who
were present, received from him the most encouraging promises. All was
joy and satisfaction, and nothing more was required for the general
happiness, save the arrival of Lorenzo, Don Antonio, and Don Juan.</p>
<p>They came on the third day, all intensely anxious to know if the duke
had received intelligence of Cornelia, seeing that Fabio, who did not
know what had happened, could tell them nothing on that subject.</p>
<p>The duke received them alone in the antechamber, but gave no sign of
gladness in his face, to their great grief and disappointment. Bidding
them be seated, Alfonso himself sat down, and thus addressed Lorenzo:—</p>
<p>"You well know, Signor Lorenzo Bentivoglio, that I never deceived your
sister, as my conscience and Heaven itself can bear witness; you know
also the diligence with which I have sought her, and the wish I have
felt to have my marriage with her celebrated publicly. But she is not to
be found, and my word cannot be considered eternally engaged to a
shadow. I am a young man, and am not so <i>blasé</i> as to leave ungathered
such pleasures as I find on my path. Before I had ever seen Cornelia I
had given my promise to a peasant girl of this village, but whom I was
tempted to abandon by the superior charms of Cornelia, giving therein a
great proof of my love for the latter, in defiance of the voice of my
conscience. Now, therefore, since no one can marry a woman who does not
appear, and it is not reasonable that a man should eternally run after a
wife who deserts him, lest he should take to his arms one who abhors
him, I would have you consider, Signor Lorenzo, whether I can give you
any further satisfaction for an affront which was never intended to be
one; and further, I would have you give me your permission to accomplish
my first promise, and solemnise my marriage with the peasant girl, who
is now in this house."</p>
<p>While the duke spoke this, Lorenzo's frequent change of colour, and the
difficulty with which he forced himself to retain his seat, gave
manifest proof that anger was taking possession of all his senses. The
same feelings agitated Don Antonio and Don Juan, who were resolved not
to permit the duke to fulfil his intention, even should they be
compelled to prevent it by depriving him of life. Alfonso, reading these
resolves in their faces, resumed: "Endeavour to calm yourself, Signor
Lorenzo; and before you answer me one word, I will have you see the
beauty of her whom I desire to take to wife, for it is such that you
cannot refuse your consent, and it might suffice, as you will
acknowledge, to excuse a graver error than mine."</p>
<p>So saying, the duke rose, and repaired to the apartment where Cornelia
was awaiting him in all the splendour of her beauty and rich
decorations. No sooner was he gone than Don Juan also rose, and laying
both hands on the arms of Lorenzo's chair, he said to him, "By St. James
of Galicia, by the true faith of a Christian, and by my honour as a
gentleman, Signor Lorenzo, I will as readily allow the duke to fulfil
his project as I will become a worshipper of Mahomed. Here, in this
spot, he shall yield up his life at my hands, or he shall redeem the
promise given to your sister, the lady Cornelia. At the least, he shall
give us time to seek her; and until we know to a certainty that she is
dead, he shall not marry."</p>
<p>"That is exactly my own view," replied Lorenzo. "And I am sure,"
rejoined Don Juan, "that it will be the determination of my comrade, Don
Antonio, likewise."</p>
<p>While they were thus speaking, Cornelia appeared at the door between the
duke and the priest, each of whom led her by one hand. Behind them came
Sulpicia, her waiting woman, whom the duke had summoned from Ferrara to
attend her lady, with the infant's nurse, and the Spaniards'
housekeeper. When Lorenzo saw his sister, and had assured himself it was
indeed Cornelia,—for at first the apparently impossible character of
the occurrence had forbidden his belief,—he staggered on his feet, and
cast himself at those of the duke, who, raising him, placed him in the
arms of his delighted sister, whilst Don Juan and Don Antonio hastily
applauded the duke for the clever trick he had played upon them all.</p>
<p>Alfonso then took the infant from Sulpicia, and, presenting it to
Lorenzo, he said, "Signor and brother, receive your nephew, my son, and
see whether it please you to give permission for the public
solemnisation of my marriage with this peasant girl—the only one to
whom I have ever been betrothed."</p>
<p>To repeat the replies of Lorenzo would be never to make an end, and the
rather if to these we added the questions of Don Juan, the remarks of
Don Antonio, the expressions of delight uttered by the priest, the
rejoicing of Sulpicia, the satisfaction of the housekeeper who had made
herself the counsellor of Cornelia, the exclamations of the nurse, and
the astonishment of Fabio, with the general happiness of all.</p>
<p>The marriage ceremony was performed by the good priest, and Don Juan de
Gamboa gave away the bride; but it was agreed among the parties that
this marriage also should be kept secret, until he knew the result of
the malady under which the duchess-dowager was labouring; for the
present, therefore, it was determined that Cornelia should return to
Bologna with her brother. All was done as thus agreed on; and when the
duchess-dowager died, Cornelia made her entrance into Ferrara, rejoicing
the eyes of all who beheld her: the mourning weeds were exchanged for
festive robes, the two housekeepers were enriched, and Sulpicia was
married to Fabio. For Don Antonio and Don Juan, they were sufficiently
rewarded by the services they had rendered to the duke, who offered them
two of his cousins in marriage, with rich dowries. But they replied,
that the gentlemen of the Biscayan nation married for the most part in
their own country; wherefore, not because they despised so honourable a
proffer, which was not possible, but that they might not depart from a
custom so laudable, they were compelled to decline that illustrious
alliance, and the rather as they were still subject to the will of their
parents, who had, most probably, already affianced them.</p>
<p>The duke admitted the validity of their excuses, but, availing himself
of occasions warranted by custom and courtesy, he found means to load
the two friends with rich gifts, which he sent from time to time to
their house in Bologna. Many of these were of such value, that although
they might have been refused for fear of seeming to receive a payment,
yet the appropriate manner in which they were presented, and the
particular periods at which Alfonso took care that they should arrive,
caused their acceptance to be easy, not to say inevitable; such, for
example, were those despatched by him at the moment of their departure
for their own country, and those which he gave them when they came to
Ferrara to take their leave of him.</p>
<p>At this period, the Spanish gentlemen found Cornelia the mother of two
little girls, and the duke more enamoured of his wife than ever. The
duchess gave the diamond cross to Don Juan, and the gold agnus to Don
Antonio, both of whom had now no choice but to accept them. They finally
arrived without accident in their native Spain, where they married rich,
noble, and beautiful ladies; and they never ceased to maintain a
friendly correspondence with the duke and duchess of Ferrara, and with
Lorenzo Bentivoglio, to the great satisfaction of all parties.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00007"><i>Or, Peter of the Corner and the Little Cutter.</i></h3>
<p>At the Venta or hostelry of the Mulinillo, which is situate on the
confines of the renowned plain of Alcudia, and on the road from Castile
to Andalusia, two striplings met by chance on one of the hottest days of
summer. One of them was about fourteen or fifteen years of age; the
other could not have passed his seventeenth year. Both were well formed,
and of comely features, but in very ragged and tattered plight. Cloaks
they had none; their breeches were of linen, and their stockings were
merely those bestowed on them by Nature. It is true they boasted shoes;
one of them wore alpargates,<a id="FNanchor_6_6"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_6_6" class="pginternal"><sup>[6]</sup></a> or rather dragged them along at his
heels; the other had what might as well have been shackles for all the
good they did the wearer, being rent in the uppers, and without soles.
Their respective head-dresses were a montera<a id="FNanchor_7_7"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_7_7" class="pginternal"><sup>[7]</sup></a> and a miserable
sombrero, low in the crown and wide in the brim. On his shoulder, and
crossing his breast like a scarf, one of them carried a shirt, the
colour of chamois leather; the body of this garment was rolled up and
thrust into one of its sleeves: the other, though travelling without
incumbrance, bore on his chest what seemed a large pack, but which
proved, on closer inspection, to be the remains of a starched ruff, now
stiffened with grease instead of starch, and so worn and frayed that it
looked like a bundle of hemp.</p>
<p>Within this collar, wrapped up and carefully treasured, was a pack of
cards, excessively dirty, and reduced to an oval form by repeated paring
of their dilapidated corners. The lads were both much burned by the sun,
their hands were anything but clean, and their long nails were edged
with black; one had a dudgeon-dagger by his side; the other a knife with
a yellow handle.</p>
<p>These gentlemen had selected for their siesta the porch or penthouse
commonly found before a Venta; and, finding themselves opposite each
other, he who appeared to be the elder said to the younger, "Of what
country is your worship, noble Sir, and by what road do you propose to
travel?" "What is my country, Señor Cavalier," returned the other, "I
know not; nor yet which way my road lies."</p>
<p>"Your worship, however, does not appear to have come from heaven,"
rejoined the elder, "and as this is not a place wherein a man can take
up his abode for good, you must, of necessity, be going further." "That
is true," replied the younger; "I have, nevertheless, told you only the
veritable fact; for as to my country, it is mine no more, since all that
belongs to me there is a father who does not consider me his child, and
a step-mother who treats me like a son-in-law. With regard to my road,
it is that which chance places before me, and it will end wherever I may
find some one who will give me the wherewithal to sustain this miserable
life of mine."</p>
<p>"Is your worship acquainted with any craft?" inquired the first speaker.
"With none," returned the other, "except that I can run like a hare,
leap like a goat, and handle a pair of scissors with great dexterity."</p>
<p>"These things are all very good, useful, and profitable," rejoined the
elder. "You will readily find the Sacristan of some church who will give
your worship the offering-bread of All Saints' Day, for cutting him his
paper flowers to decorate the Monument<a id="FNanchor_8_8"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_8_8" class="pginternal"><sup>[8]</sup></a> on Holy Thursday."</p>
<p>"But that is not my manner of cutting," replied the younger. "My father,
who, by God's mercy, is a tailor and hose maker, taught me to cut out
that kind of spatterdashes properly called Polainas, which, as your
worship knows, cover the fore part of the leg and come down over the
instep. These I can cut out in such style, that I could pass an
examination for the rank of master in the craft; but my ill luck keeps
my talents in obscurity."</p>
<p>"The common lot, Señor, of able men," replied the first speaker, "for I
have always heard that it is the way of the world to let the finest
talents go to waste; but your worship is still at an age when this evil
fortune may be remedied, and the rather since, if I mistake not, and my
eyes do not deceive me, you have other advantageous qualities which it
is your pleasure to keep secret." "It is true that I have such,"
returned the younger gentleman, "but they are not of a character to be
publicly proclaimed, as your worship has very judiciously observed."</p>
<p>"But I," rejoined the elder, "may with confidence assure you, that I am
one of the most discreet and prudent persons to be found within many a
league. In order to induce your worship to open your heart and repose
your faith on my honour, I will enlist your sympathies by first laying
bare my own bosom; for I imagine that fate has not brought us together
without some hidden purpose. Nay, I believe that we are to be true
friends from this day to the end of our lives.</p>
<p>"I, then, Señor Hidalgo, am a native of Fuenfrida, a place very well
known, indeed renowned for the illustrious travellers who are constantly
passing through it. My name is Pedro del Rincon,<a id="FNanchor_9_9"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_9_9" class="pginternal"><sup>[9]</sup></a> my father is a
person of quality, and a Minister of the Holy Crusade, since he holds
the important charge of a Bulero or Buldero,<a id="FNanchor_10_10"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_10_10" class="pginternal"><sup>[10]</sup></a> as the vulgar call it.
I was for some time his assistant in that office, and acquitted myself
so well, that in all things concerning the sale of bulls I could hold my
own with any man, though he had the right to consider himself the most
accomplished in the profession. But one day, having placed my affections
on the money produced by the bulls, rather than on the bulls themselves,
I took a bag of crowns to my arms, and we two departed together for
Madrid.</p>
<p>"In that city, such are the facilities that offer themselves, I soon
gutted my bag, and left it with as many wrinkles as a bridegroom's
pocket-handkerchief. The person who was charged with the collection of
the money, hastened to track my steps; I was taken, and met with but
scant indulgence; only, in consideration of my youth, their worships the
judges contented themselves with introducing me to the acquaintance of
the whipping-post, to have the flies whisked from my shoulders for a
certain time, and commanding me to abstain from revisiting the Court and
Capital during a period of four years. I took the matter coolly, bent my
shoulders to the operation performed at their command, and made so much
haste to begin my prescribed term of exile, that I had no time to
procure sumpter mules, but contented myself with selecting from my
valuables such as seemed most important and useful.</p>
<p>"I did not fail to include this pack of cards among them,"—here the
speaker exhibited that oviform specimen already mentioned—"and with
these I have gained my bread among the inns and taverns between Madrid
and this place, by playing at Vingt-et-un. It is true they are somewhat
soiled and worn, as your worship sees; but for him who knows how to
handle them, they possess a marvellous virtue, which is, that you never
cut them but you find an ace at the bottom; if your worship then is
acquainted with the game, you will see what an advantage it is to know
for certain that you have an ace to begin with, since you may count it
either for one or eleven; and so you may be pretty sure that when the
stakes are laid at twenty-one, your money will be much disposed to stay
at home.</p>
<p>"In addition to this, I have acquired the knowledge of certain mysteries
regarding Lansquenet and Reversis, from the cook of an ambassador who
shall be nameless,—insomuch that, even as your worship might pass as
master in the cutting of spatterdashes, so could I, too, take my degrees
in the art of flat-catching.</p>
<p>"With all these acquirements, I am tolerably sure of not dying from
hunger, since, even in the most retired farm-house I come to, there is
always some one to be found who will not refuse himself the recreation
of a few moments at cards. We have but to make a trial where we are; let
us spread the net, and it will go hard with us if some bird out of all
the Muleteers standing about do not fall into it. I mean to say, that if
we two begin now to play at Vingt-et-un as though we were in earnest,
some one will probably desire to make a third, and, in that case, he
shall be the man to leave his money behind him."</p>
<p>"With all my heart," replied the younger lad: "and I consider that your
excellency has done me a great favour by communicating to me the history
of your life. You have thereby made it impossible for me to conceal
mine, and I will hasten to relate it as briefly as possible. Here it is,
then:—</p>
<p>"I was born at Pedroso, a village situate between Salamanca and Medina
del Campo. My father is a tailor, as I have said, and taught me his
trade; but from cutting with the scissors I proceeded—my natural
abilities coming in aid—to the cutting of purses. The dull, mean life
of the village, and the unloving conduct of my mother-in-law, were
besides but little to my taste. I quitted my birthplace, therefore,
repaired to Toledo to exercise my art, and succeeded in it to
admiration; for there is not a reliquary suspended to the dress, not a
pocket, however carefully concealed, but my fingers shall probe its
contents, or my scissors snip it off, though the owner were guarded by
the eyes of Argus.</p>
<p>"During four months I spent in Toledo, I was never trapped between two
doors, nor caught in the fact, nor pursued by the runners of justice,
nor blown upon by an informer. It is true that, eight days ago, a double
spy<a id="FNanchor_11_11"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_11_11" class="pginternal"><sup>[11]</sup></a> did set forth my distinguished abilities to the Corregidor, and
the latter, taking a fancy to me from his description, desired to make
my acquaintance; but I am a modest youth, and do not wish to frequent
the society of personages so important. Wherefore I took pains to excuse
myself from visiting him, and departed in so much haste, that I, like
yourself, had no time to procure sumpter-mules or small change,—nay, I
could not even find a return-chaise, nor so much as a cart."</p>
<p>"Console yourself for these omissions," replied Pedro del Rincon; "and
since we now know each other, let us drop these grand and stately airs,
and confess frankly that we have not a blessed farthing between us, nor
even shoes to our feet."</p>
<p>"Be it so," returned Diego Cortado, for so the younger boy called
himself. "Be it so; and since our friendship, as your worship Señor
Rincon is pleased to say, is to last our whole lives, let us begin it
with solemn and laudable ceremonies,"—saying which, Diego rose to his
feet, and embraced the Señor Rincon, who returned the compliment with
equal tenderness and emotion.</p>
<p>They then began to play at Vingt-et-un with the cards above described,
which were certainly "free from dust and straw,"<a id="FNanchor_12_12"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_12_12" class="pginternal"><sup>[12]</sup></a> as we say, but by
no means free from grease and knavery; and after a few deals, Cortado
could turn up an ace as well as Rincon his master. When things had
attained this point, it chanced that a Muleteer came out at the porch,
and, as Rincon had anticipated, he soon proposed to make a third in
their game.</p>
<p>To this they willingly agreed, and in less than half an hour they had
won from him twelve reals and twenty-two maravedis, which he felt as
sorely as twelve stabs with a dagger and twenty-two thousand sorrows.
Presuming that the young chaps would not venture to defend themselves,
he thought to get back his money by force; but the two friends laying
hands promptly, the one on his dudgeon dagger and the other on his
yellow handled knife, gave the Muleteer so much to do, that if his
companions had not hastened to assist him, he would have come badly out
of the quarrel.</p>
<p>At that moment there chanced to pass by a company of travellers on
horseback, who were going to make their siesta at the hostelry of the
Alcalde, about half a league farther on. Seeing the affray between the
Muleteer with two boys, they interposed, and offered to take the latter
in their company to Seville, if they were going to that city.</p>
<p>"That is exactly where we desire to go," exclaimed Rincon, "and we will
serve your worships in all that it shall please you to command."
Whereupon, without more ado, they sprang before the mules, and departed
with the travellers, leaving the Muleteer despoiled of his money and
furious with rage, while the hostess was in great admiration of the
finished education and accomplishments of the two rogues, whose dialogue
she had heard from beginning to end, while they were not aware of her
presence.</p>
<p>When the hostess told the Muleteer that she had heard the boys say the
cards they played with were false, the man tore his beard for rage, and
would have followed them to the other Venta, in the hope of recovering
his property; for he declared it to be a serious affront, and a matter
touching his honour, that two boys should have cheated a grown man like
him. But his companions dissuaded him from doing what they declared
would be nothing better than publishing his own folly and incapacity;
and their arguments, although they did not console the Muleteer, were
sufficient to make him remain where he was.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Cortado and Rincon displayed so much zeal and readiness in the
service of the travellers, that the latter gave them a lift behind them
for the greater part of the way. They might many a time have rifled the
portmanteaus of their temporary masters, but did not, lest they should
thereby lose the happy opportunity of seeing Seville, in which city they
greatly desired to exercise their talents. Nevertheless, as they entered
Seville—which they did at the hour of evening prayer, and by the gate
of the custom-house, on account of the dues to be paid, and the trunks
to be examined—Cortado could not refrain from making an examination, on
his own account, of the valise which a Frenchman of the company carried
with him on the croup of his mule. With his yellow-handled weapon,
therefore, he gave it so deep and broad a wound in the side that its
very entrails were exposed to view; and he dexterously drew forth two
good shirts, a sun-dial, and a memorandum book, things that did not
greatly please him when he had leisure to examine them. Thinking that
since the Frenchman carried that valise on his own mule, it must needs
contain matters of more importance than those he had captured, Cortado
would fain have looked further into it, but he abstained, as it was
probable that the deficiency had been already discovered, and the
remaining effects secured. Before performing this feat the friends had
taken leave of those who had fed them on their journey, and the
following day they sold the two shirts in the old clothes' market, which
is held at the gate of the Almacen or arsenal, obtaining twenty reals
for their booty.</p>
<p>Having despatched this business, they went to see the city, and admired
the great magnificence and vast size of its principal church, and the
vast concourse of people on the quays, for it happened to be the season
for loading the fleet. There were also six galleys on the water, at
sight of which the friends could not refrain from sighing, as they
thought the day might come when they should be clapped on board one of
those vessels for the remainder of their lives. They remarked the large
number of basket-boys, porters, &amp;c., who went to and fro about the
ships, and inquired of one among them what sort of a trade it
was—whether it was very laborious—and what were the gains.</p>
<p>An Asturian, of whom they made the inquiry, gave answer to the effect
that the trade was a very pleasant one, since they had no harbour-dues
to pay, and often found themselves at the end of the day with six or
seven reals in their pocket, with which they might eat, drink, and enjoy
themselves like kings. Those of his calling, he said, had no need to
seek a master to whom security must be given, and you could dine when
and where you please, since, in the city of Seville, there is not an
eating-house, however humble, where you will not find all you want at
any hour of the day.</p>
<p>The account given by the Asturian was by no means discouraging to the
two friends, neither did his calling seem amiss to them; nay, rather, it
appeared to be invented for the very purpose of enabling them to
exercise their own profession in secresy and safety, on account of the
facilities it offered for entering houses. They consequently determined
to buy such things as were required for the instant adoption of the new
trade, especially as they could enter upon it without undergoing any
previous scrutiny.</p>
<p>In reply to their further inquiries, the Asturian told them that it
would be sufficient if each had a small porter's bag of linen, either
new or second-hand, so it was but clean, with three palm-baskets, two
large and one small, wherein to carry the meat, fish, and fruit
purchased by their employers, while the bag was to be used for carrying
the bread. He took them to where all these things were sold; they
supplied themselves out of the plunder of the Frenchman, and in less
than two hours they might have been taken for regular graduates in their
new profession, so deftly did they manage their baskets, and so jauntily
carry their bags. Their instructor furthermore informed them of the
different places at which they were to make their appearance daily: in
the morning at the shambles, and at the market of St. Salvador; on
fast-days at the fish-market; every afternoon on the quay, and on
Thursdays at the fair.</p>
<p>All these lessons the two friends carefully stored in their memory, and
the following morning both repaired in good time to the market of St.
Salvador. Scarcely had they arrived before they were remarked by numbers
of young fellows of the trade, who soon perceived, by the shining
brightness of their bags and baskets, that they were new beginners. They
were assailed with a thousand questions, to all which they replied with
great presence of mind and discretion. Presently up came two customers,
one of whom had the appearance of a Student, the other was a Soldier;
both were attracted by the clean and new appearance of their baskets;
and he who seemed to be a student beckoned Cortado, while the soldier
engaged Rincon. "In God's name be it!"<a id="FNanchor_13_13"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_13_13" class="pginternal"><sup>[13]</sup></a> exclaimed both the novices in
a breath—Rincon adding, "It is a good beginning of the trade, master,
since it is your worship that is giving me my hansel." "The hansel shall
not be a bad one," replied the soldier, "seeing that I have been lucky
at cards of late, and am in love. I propose this day to regale the
friends of my lady with a feast, and am come to buy the materials."
"Load away, then, your worship," replied Rincon, "and lay on me as much
as you please, for I feel courage enough to carry off the whole market;
nay, if you should desire me to aid in cooking what I carry, it shall be
done with all my heart."</p>
<p>The soldier was pleased with the boy's ready good-will, and told him
that if he felt disposed to enter his service he would relieve him from
the degrading office he then bore; but Rincon declared, that since this
was the first day on which he had tried it, he was not willing to
abandon the work so soon, or at least until he had seen what profit
there was to be made of it; but if it did not suit him, he gave the
gentleman his word that he would prefer the service offered him even to
that of a Canon.</p>
<p>The soldier laughed, loaded him well, and showed him the house of his
lady, bidding him observe it well that he might know it another time, so
that he might be able to send him there again without being obliged to
accompany him. Rincon promised fidelity and good conduct; the soldier
gave him three quartos,<a id="FNanchor_14_14"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_14_14" class="pginternal"><sup>[14]</sup></a> and the lad returned like a shot to the
market, that he might lose no opportunity by delay. Besides, he had been
well advised in respect of diligence by the Asturian, who had likewise
told him that when he was employed to carry small fish, such as sprats,
sardines, or flounders, he might very well take a few for himself and
have the first taste of them, were it only to diminish his expenses of
the day, but that he must do this with infinite caution and prudence,
lest the confidence of the employers should be disturbed; for to
maintain confidence was above all things important in their trade.</p>
<p>But whatever haste Rincon had made to return, he found Cortado at his
post before him. The latter instantly inquired how he had got on. Rincon
opened his hand and showed the three quartos; when Cortado, thrusting
his arm into his bosom, drew forth a little purse which appeared to have
once been of amber-coloured silk, and was not badly filled. "It was with
this," said he, "that my service to his reverence the Student has been
rewarded—with this and two quartos besides. Do you take it, Rincon, for
fear of what may follow."</p>
<p>Cortado had scarcely given the purse in secret to his companion, before
the Student returned in a great heat, and looking in mortal alarm. He no
sooner set eyes on Cortado, than, hastening towards him, he inquired if
he had by chance seen a purse with such and such marks and tokens, and
which had disappeared, together with fifteen crowns in gold pieces,
three double reals, and a certain number of maravedis in quartos and
octavos. "Did you take it from me yourself," he added, "while I was
buying in the market, with you standing beside me?"</p>
<p>To this Cortado replied with perfect composure, "All I can tell you of
your purse is, that it cannot be lost, unless, indeed, your worship has
left it in bad hands."</p>
<p>"That is the very thing, sinner that I am," returned the Student. "To a
certainty I must have left it in bad hands, since it has been stolen
from me." "I say the same," rejoined Cortado, "but there is a remedy for
every misfortune excepting death. The best thing your worship can do
now is to have patience, for after all it is God who has made us, and
after one day there comes another. If one hour gives us wealth, another
takes it away; but it may happen that the man who has stolen your purse
may in time repent, and may return it to your worship, with all the
interest due on the loan."</p>
<p>"The interest I will forgive him," exclaimed the Student; and Cortado
resumed:—"There are, besides, those letters of excommunication, the
Paulinas;<a id="FNanchor_15_15"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_15_15" class="pginternal"><sup>[15]</sup></a> and there is also good diligence in seeking for the thief,
which is the mother of success. Of a truth, Sir, I would not willingly
be in the place of him who has stolen your purse; for if your worship
have received any of the sacred orders, I should feel as if I had been
guilty of some great crime—nay of sacrilege—in stealing from your
person."</p>
<p>"Most certainly the thief has committed a sacrilege," replied the
Student, in pitiable tones; "for although I am not in orders, but am
only a Sacristan of certain nuns, yet the money in my purse was the
third of the income due from a chapelry, which I had been commissioned
to receive by a priest, who is one of my friends, so that the purse
does, in fact, contain blessed and sacred money."</p>
<p>"Let him eat his sin with his bread," exclaimed Rincon at that moment;
"I should be sorry to become bail for the profit he will obtain from it.
There will be a day of judgment at the last, when all things will have
to pass, as they say, through the holes of the colander, and it will
then be known who was the scoundrel that has had the audacity to plunder
and make off with the whole third of the revenue of a chapelry! But tell
me, Mr. Sacristan, on your life, what is the amount of the whole yearly
income?"</p>
<p>"Income to the devil, and you with it,<a id="FNanchor_16_16"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_16_16" class="pginternal"><sup>[16]</sup></a>" replied the Sacristan, with
more rage than was becoming; "am I in a humour to talk to you about
income? Tell me, brother, if you know anything of the purse; if not, God
be with you—I must go and have it cried."</p>
<p>"That does not seem to me so bad a remedy," remarked Cortado; "but I
warn your worship not to forget the precise description of the purse,
nor the exact sum that it contains; for if you commit the error of a
single mite, the money will never be suffered to appear again while the
world is a world, and that you may take for a prophecy."</p>
<p>"I am not afraid of committing any mistake in describing the purse,"
returned the Sacristan, "for I remember it better than I do the ringing
of my bells, and I shall not commit the error of an atom." Saying this,
he drew a laced handkerchief from his pocket to wipe away the
perspiration which rained down his face as from an alembic; but no
sooner had Cortado set eyes on the handkerchief, than he marked it for
his own.</p>
<p>When the Sacristan had got to a certain distance, therefore, Cortado
followed, and having overtaken him as he was mounting the steps of a
church, he took him apart, and poured forth so interminable a string of
rigmarole, all about the theft of the purse, and the prospect of
recovering it, that the poor Sacristan could do nothing but listen with
open mouth, unable to make head or tail of what he said, although he
made him repeat it two or three times.</p>
<p>Cortado meanwhile continued to look fixedly into the eyes of the
Sacristan, whose own were rivetted on the face of the boy, and seemed to
hang, as it were, on his words. This gave Cortado an opportunity to
finish his job, and having cleverly whipped the handkerchief out of the
pocket, he took leave of the Sacristan, appointing to meet him in the
evening at the same place, for he suspected that a certain lad of his
own height and the same occupation, who was a bit of a thief, had stolen
the purse, and he should be able to ascertain the fact in a few days,
more or less.</p>
<p>Somewhat consoled by this promise, the Sacristan took his leave of
Cortado, who then returned to the place where Rincon had privily
witnessed all that had passed. But a little behind him stood another
basket-boy, who had also seen the whole transaction; and at the moment
when Cortado passed the handkerchief to Rincon, the stranger accosted
the pair.</p>
<p>"Tell me, gallant gentlemen," said he, "are you admitted to the Mala
Entrada,<a id="FNanchor_17_17"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_17_17" class="pginternal"><sup>[17]</sup></a> or not?"</p>
<p>"We do not understand your meaning, noble Sir," replied Rincon.</p>
<p>"How! not entered, brave Murcians?" replied the other.</p>
<p>"We are neither of Murcia<a id="FNanchor_18_18"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_18_18" class="pginternal"><sup>[18]</sup></a> nor of Thebes," replied Cortado. "If you
have anything else to say to us, speak; if not, go your ways, and God be
with you."</p>
<p>"Oh, your worships do not understand, don't you?" said the porter; "but
I will soon make you understand, and even sup up my meaning with a
silver spoon. I mean to ask you, gentlemen, are your worships thieves?
But why put the question, since I see well that you are thieves; and it
is rather for you to tell me how it is that you have not presented
yourselves at the custom-house of the Señor Monipodio."</p>
<p>"Do they then pay duty on the right of thieving in this country, gallant
Sir?" exclaimed Rincon.</p>
<p>"If they do not pay duty, at least they make them register themselves
with the Señor Monipodio, who is the father, master, and protector of
thieves; and I recommend you to come with me and pay your respects to
him forthwith, or, if you refuse to do that, make no attempt to exercise
your trade without his mark and pass-word, or it will cost you dearly."</p>
<p>"I thought, for my part," remarked Cortado, "that the profession of
thieving was a free one, exempt from all taxes and port dues; or, at
least, that if we must pay, it is something to be levied in the lump,
for which we give a mortgage upon our shoulders and our necks; but since
it is as you say, and every land has its customs, let us pay due respect
to this of yours; we are now in the first country of the world, and
without doubt the customs of the place must be in the highest degree
judicious. Wherefore your worship may be pleased to conduct us to the
place where this gentleman of whom you have spoken is to be found. I
cannot but suppose, from what you say, that he is much honoured, of
great power and influence, of very generous nature, and, above all,
highly accomplished in the profession."</p>
<p>"Honoured, generous, and accomplished! do you say?" replied the boy:
"aye, that he is; so much so, that during the four years that he has
held the seat of our chief and father, only four of us have suffered at
Finibusterry;<a id="FNanchor_19_19"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_19_19" class="pginternal"><sup>[19]</sup></a> some thirty or so, and not more, have lost leather;
and but sixty-two have been lagged."</p>
<p>"Truly, Sir," rejoined Rincon, "all this is Hebrew to us; we know no
more about it than we do of flying."</p>
<p>"Let us be jogging, then," replied the new-comer, "and on the way I will
explain to you these and other things, which it is requisite you should
know as pat as bread to mouth;" and, accordingly, he explained to them a
whole vocabulary of that thieves' Latin which they call Germanesco, or
Gerigonza, and which their guide used in the course of his lecture,—by
no means a short one, for the distance they had to traverse was of
considerable length.</p>
<p>On the road, Rincon said to his new acquaintance, "Does your worship
happen to be a Thief?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the lad, "I have that honour, for the service of God and
of all good people; but I cannot boast of being among the most
distinguished, since I am as yet but in the year of my novitiate."</p>
<p>"It is news to me," remarked Cortado, "that there are thieves for the
service of God and of good people."</p>
<p>"Señor," the other replied, "I don't meddle with theology; but this I
know, that every one may serve God in his vocation, the more so as daddy
Monipodio keeps such good order in that respect among all his children."</p>
<p>"His must needs be a holy and edifying command," rejoined Rincon, "since
it enjoins thieves to serve God."</p>
<p>"It is so holy and edifying," exclaimed the stranger, "that I don't
believe a better will ever be known in our trade. His orders are that we
give something by way of alms out of all we steal, to buy oil for the
lamp of a highly venerated image, well known in this city; and we have
really seen great things result from that good work. Not many days ago,
one of our <i>cuatreros</i> had to take three <i>ansias</i> for having come the
Murcian over a couple of <i>roznos</i>, and although he was but a poor weak
fellow, and ill of the fever to boot, he bore them all without singing
out, as though they had been mere trifles. This we of the profession
attribute to his particular devotion to the Virgin of the Lamp, for he
was so weak, that, of his own strength, he could not have endured the
first <i>desconcierto</i> of the hangman's wrist. But now, as I guess, you
will want to know the meaning of certain words just used; I will take
physic before I am sick—that is to say, give you the explanation before
you ask for it.</p>
<p>"Be pleased to know then, gentlemen, that a <i>cuatrero</i> is a stealer of
cattle, the <i>ansia</i> is the question or torture. <i>Roznos</i>—saving your
presence—are asses, and the first <i>desconcierto</i> is the first turn of
the cord which is given by the executioner when we are on the rack. But
we do more than burn oil to the Virgin. There is not one of us who does
not recite his rosary carefully, dividing it into portions for each day
of the week. Many will not steal at all on a Friday, and on Saturdays we
never speak to any woman who is called Mary."</p>
<p>"All these things fill me with admiration," replied Cortado; "but may I
trouble your worship to tell me, have you no other penance than this to
perform? Is there no restitution to make?"</p>
<p>"As to restitution," returned the other, "it is a thing not to be
mentioned; besides, it would be wholly impossible, on account of the
numerous portions into which things stolen have to be divided before
each one of the agents and contractors has received the part due to him.
When all these have had their share, the original thief would find it
difficult to make restitution. Moreover, there is no one to bid us do
anything of that kind, seeing that we do not go to confession. And if
letters of excommunication are out against us, they rarely come to our
knowledge, because we take care not to go into the churches while the
priests are reading them, unless, indeed, it be on the days of Jubilee,
for then we do go, on account of the vast profits we make from the
crowds of people assembled on that occasion."</p>
<p>"And proceeding in this manner," observed Cortado, "your worships think
that your lives are good and holy?"</p>
<p>"Certainly! for what is there bad in them?" replied the other lad! "Is
it not worse to be a heretic or a renegade? or to kill your father or
mother?"</p>
<p>"Without doubt," admitted Cortado; "but now, since our fate has decided
that we are to enter this brotherhood, will your worship be pleased to
step out a little, for I am dying to behold this Señor Monipodio, of
whose virtues you relate such fine things."</p>
<p>"That wish shall soon be gratified," replied the stranger, "nay even
from this place we can perceive his house: but your worships must remain
at the door until I have gone in to see if he be disengaged, since these
are the hours at which he gives audience."</p>
<p>"So be it," replied Rincon; and the thief preceding them for a short
distance, they saw him enter a house which, so far from being handsome,
had a very mean and wretched appearance. The two friends remained at the
door to await their guide, who soon reappeared, and called to them to
come in. He then bade them remain for the present in a little paved
court, or patio,<a id="FNanchor_20_20"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_20_20" class="pginternal"><sup>[20]</sup></a> so clean and carefully rubbed that the red bricks
shone as if covered with the finest vermilion. On one side of the court
was a three-legged stool, before which stood a large pitcher with the
lip broken off, and on the top of the pitcher was placed a small jug
equally dilapidated. On the other side lay a rush mat, and in the middle
was a fragment of crockery which did service as the recipient of some
sweet basil.</p>
<p>The two boys examined these moveables attentively while awaiting the
descent of the Señor Monipodio, but finding that he delayed his
appearance, Rincon ventured to put his head into one of two small rooms
which opened on the court. There he saw two fencing foils, and two
bucklers of cork hung upon four nails; there was also a great chest, but
without a lid or anything to cover it, with three rush mats extended on
the floor. On the wall in face of him was pasted a figure of Our
Lady—one of the coarsest of prints—and beneath it was a small basket
of straw, with a little vessel of white earthenware sunk into the wall.
The basket Rincon took to be a poor box, for receiving alms, and the
little basin he supposed to be a receptacle for holy water, as in truth
they were.</p>
<p>While the friends thus waited, there came into the court two young men
of some twenty years each; they were clothed as students, and were
followed soon afterwards by two of the basket boys or porters, and a
blind man. Neither spoke a word to the other, but all began to walk up
and down in the court. No long time elapsed before there also came in
two old men clothed in black serge, and with spectacles on their noses,
which gave them an air of much gravity, and made them look highly
respectable: each held in his hand a rosary, the beads of which made a
ringing sound. Behind these men came an old woman wearing a long and
ample gown, who, without uttering a word, proceeded at once to the room
wherein was the figure of Our Lady. She then took holy water with the
greatest devotion, placed herself on her knees before the Virgin, and
after remaining there a considerable time, first kissed the soil thrice,
and then rising, lifted her arms and eyes towards heaven, in which
attitude she remained a certain time longer. She then dropped her alms
into the little wicker case—and that done, she issued forth among the
company in the patio.</p>
<p>Finally there were assembled in the court as many as fourteen persons of
various costumes and different professions. Among the latest arrivals
were two dashing and elegant youths with long moustachios, hats of
immense brims, broad collars, stiffly starched, coloured stockings,
garters with great bows and fringed ends, swords of a length beyond that
permitted by law, and each having a pistol in his belt, with a buckler
hanging on his arm. No sooner had these men entered, than they began to
look askance at Rincon and Cortado, whom they were evidently surprised
to see there, as persons unknown to themselves. At length the new-comers
accosted the two friends, asking if they were of the brotherhood. "We
are so," replied Rincon, "and the very humble servants of your worships
besides."</p>
<p>At this moment the Señor Monipodio honoured the respectable assembly
with his welcome presence. He appeared to be about five or six-and-forty
years old, tall, and of dark complexion; his eyebrows met on his
forehead, his black beard was very thick, and his eyes were deeply sunk
in his head. He had come down in his shirt, through the opening of which
was seen a hairy bosom, as rough and thick set as a forest of brushwood.
Over his shoulders was thrown a serge cloak, reaching nearly to his
feet, which were cased in old shoes, cut down to make slippers; his legs
were covered with a kind of linen gaiters, wide and ample, which fell
low upon his ankles. His hat was that worn by those of the Hampa,
bell-formed in the crown, and very wide in the brim.<a id="FNanchor_21_21"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_21_21" class="pginternal"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Across his
breast was a leather baldric, supporting a broad, short sword of the
<i>perrillo</i> fashion.<a id="FNanchor_22_22"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_22_22" class="pginternal"><sup>[22]</sup></a> His hands were short and coarse, the fingers
thick, and the nails much flattened: his legs were concealed by the
gaiters, but his feet were of immoderate size, and the most clumsy form.
In short, he was the coarsest and most repulsive barbarian ever beheld.
With him came the conductor of the two friends; who, taking Rincon and
Cortado each by a hand, presented them to Monipodio, saying, "These are
the two good boys of whom I spoke to your worship, Señor Monipodio. May
it please your worship to examine them, and you will see how well they
are prepared to enter our brotherhood." "That I will do willingly,"
replied Monipodio.</p>
