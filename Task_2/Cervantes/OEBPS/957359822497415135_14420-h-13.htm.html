<body class="x-ebookmaker x-ebookmaker-2"><p>"So these two chaps are engaged, are they?" said another of the
servant-women; "by my soul, if I had to keep them company I would never
trust them with the wine-bag."</p>
<p>"None of your gibes, señora Gallega," cried her master; "do your work,
and don't meddle with the men-servants, or I'll baste you with a stick."</p>
<p>"Oh, to be sure!" replied the Gallician damsel; "a'nt they dainty dears
to make a body's mouth water? I'm sure master has never known me so
frolicksome with the chaps in the house, nor yet out of it, that he
should have such an opinion of me. The blackguards go away when they
take it into their heads, without our giving them any occasion. Very
like indeed they're the right sort to be in need of any one's putting
them to bidding their masters an early good morning, when they least
expect it."</p>
<p>"You've a deal to say for yourself, my friend," said the landlord; "shut
your mouth and mind your business."</p>
<p>While this colloquy was going on Carriazo had harnessed the ass, jumped
on his back, and set off to the river, leaving Avendaño highly delighted
at witnessing his jovial resolution.</p>
<p>Here then, we have Avendaño and Carriazo changed, God save the mark!
into Tomas Pedro, a hostler, and Lope Asturiano, a water-carrier:
transformations surpassing those of the long-nosed poet. No sooner had
la Argüello heard that they were hired, than she formed a design upon
Asturiano, and marked him for her own, resolving to regale him in such a
manner, that, if he was ever so shy, she would make him as pliant as a
glove. The prudish Gallegan formed a similar design upon Avendaño, and,
as the two women were great friends, being much together in their
business by day, and bed-fellows at night, they at once confided their
amorous purposes to each other; and that night they determined to begin
the conquest of their two unimpassioned swains. Moreover they agreed
that they must, in the first place, beg them not to be jealous about
anything they might see them do with their persons; for girls could
hardly regale their friends within doors, unless they put those without
under contribution. "Hold your tongues, lads," said they, apostrophising
their absent lovers, "hold your tongues and shut your eyes; leave the
timbrel in the hands that can play it, and let those lead the dance that
know how, and no pair of canons in this city will be better regaled than
you will be by our two selves."</p>
<p>While the Gallegan and la Argüello were settling matters in this way,
our good friend, Lope Asturiano, was on his way to the river, musing
upon his beloved tunny fisheries and on his sudden change of condition.
Whether it was for this reason, or that fate ordained it so, it happened
that as he was riding down a steep and narrow lane, he ran against
another water-carrier's ass, which was coming, laden, up-hill; and, as
his own was fresh and lively and in good condition, the poor,
half-starved, jaded brute that was toiling up hill, was knocked down,
the pitchers were broken, and the water spilled. The driver of the
fallen ass, enraged by this disaster, immediately flew upon the
offender, and pommelled him soundly before poor Lope well knew where he
was. At last, his senses were roused with a vengeance, and seizing his
antagonist with both hands by the throat, he dashed him to the ground.
That was not all, for, unluckily, the man's head struck violently
against a stone; the wound was frightful, and bled so profusely, that
Lope thought he had killed him. Several other water-carriers who were on
their way to and from the river, seeing their comrade so maltreated,
seized Lope and held him fast, shouting, "Justice! justice! this
water-carrier has murdered a man." And all the while they beat and
thumped him lustily. Others ran to the fallen man, and found that his
skull was cracked, and that he was almost at the last gasp. The outcry
spread all up the hill, and to the Plaza del Carmen, where it reached
the ears of an alguazil, who flew to the spot with two police-runners.
They did not arrive a moment too soon, for they found Lope surrounded by
more than a score of water-carriers, who were basting his ribs at such a
rate that there was almost as much reason to fear for his life as that
of the wounded man. The alguazil took him out of their hands, delivered
him and his ass into those of his followers, had the wounded man laid
like a sack upon his own ass, and marched them all off to prison
attended by such a crowd that they could hardly make way through the
streets. The noise drew Tomas Pedro and his master to the door, and, to
their great surprise, they saw Asturiano led by in the gripe of two
police-runners, with his face all bloody. The landlord immediately
looked about for his ass, and saw it in the hands of another catchpoll,
who had joined the alguazil's party. He inquired the cause of these
captures, was told what had happened, and was sorely distressed on
account of his ass, fearing that he should lose it, or have to pay more
for it than it was worth.</p>
<p>Tomas followed his comrade, but could not speak a single word to him,
such was the throng round the prisoner, and the strictness of the
catchpolls. Lope was thrust into a narrow cell in the prison, with a
doubly grated window, and the wounded man was taken to the infirmary,
where the surgeon pronounced his case extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>The alguazil took home the two asses with him, besides five pieces of
eight which had been found on Lope. Tomas returned greatly disconcerted
to the inn, where he found the landlord in no better spirits than
himself, and gave him an account of the condition in which he had left
his comrade, the danger of the wounded man, and the fate of the ass. "To
add to the misfortune," said he, "I have just met a gentleman of Burgos,
who tells me that my master will not now come this way. In order to make
more speed and shorten his journey by two leagues, he has crossed the
ferry at Aceca; he will sleep to-night at Orgaz, and has sent me twelve
crowns, with orders to meet him at Seville. But that cannot be, for it
is not in reason that I should leave my friend and comrade in prison and
in such peril. My master must excuse me for the present, and I know he
will, for he is so good-natured that he will put up with a little
inconvenience rather than that I should forsake my comrade. Will you do
me the favour, señor, to take this money, and see what you can do in
this business. While you are spending this, I will write to my master
for more, telling him all that has happened, and I am sure he will send
us enough to get us out of any scrape."</p>
<p>The host opened his eyes a palm wide in glad surprise to find himself
indemnified for the loss of his ass. He took the money and comforted
Tomas, telling him that he could make interest with persons of great
influence in Toledo, especially a nun, a relation of the corregidor's,
who could do anything she pleased with him. Now the washerwoman of the
convent in which the nun lived had a daughter, who was very thick indeed
with the sister of a friar, who was hand and glove with the said nun's
confessor. All he had to do, then, was to get the washerwoman to ask her
daughter to get the monk's sister to speak to her brother to say a good
word to the confessor, who would prevail on the nun to write a note to
the corregidor begging him to look into Lope's business, and then,
beyond a doubt, they might expect to come off with flying colours; that
is provided the water-carrier did not die of his wound, and provided
also there was no lack of stuff to grease the palms of all the officers
of justice, for unless they are well greased they creak worse than the
wheels of a bullock cart.</p>
<p>Whatever Tomas thought of this roundabout way of making interest, he
failed not to thank the innkeeper, and to assure him that he was
confident his master would readily send the requisite money.</p>
<p>Argüello, who had seen her new flame in the hands of the officers, ran
directly to the prison with some dinner for him; but she was not
permitted to see him. This was a great grief to her, but she did not
lose her hopes for all that. After the lapse of a fortnight the wounded
man was out of danger, and in a week more, the surgeon pronounced him
cured. During this time, Tomas Pedro pretended to have had fifty crowns
sent to him from Seville, and taking them out of his pocket, he
presented them to the innkeeper, along with a fictitious letter from his
master. It was nothing to the landlord whether the letter was genuine or
not, so he gave himself no trouble to authenticate it; but he received
the fifty good gold crowns with great glee. The end of the matter was,
that the wounded man was quieted with six ducats, and Asturiano was
sentenced to the forfeiture of his ass, and a fine of ten ducats with
costs, on the payment of which he was liberated.</p>
<p>On his release from prison, Asturiano had no mind to go back to the
Sevillano, but excused himself to his comrade on the ground that during
his confinement he had been visited by Argüello, who had pestered him
with her fulsome advances, which were to him so sickening and
insufferable, that he would rather be hanged than comply with the
desires of so odious a jade. His intention was to buy an ass, and to do
business as a water carrier on his own account as long as they remained
in Toledo. This would protect him from the risk of being arrested as a
vagabond; besides, it was a business he could carry on with great ease
and satisfaction to himself, since with only one load of water, he could
saunter about the city all day long, looking at silly wenches.</p>
<p>"Looking at beautiful women, you mean," said his friend, "for of all the
cities in Spain, Toledo has the reputation of being that in which the
women surpass all others, whether in beauty or conduct. If you doubt it,
only look at Costanza, who could spare from her superfluity of
loveliness charms enough to beautify the rest of the women, not only of
Toledo, but of the whole world."</p>
<p>"Gently, señor Tomas; not so fast with your praises of the señora
scullion, unless you wish that, besides thinking you a fool, I take you
for a heretic into the bargain."</p>
<p>"Do you call Costanza a scullion, brother Lope? God forgive you, and
bring you to a true sense of your error."</p>
<p>"And is not she a scullion?"</p>
<p>"I have yet to see her wash the first plate."</p>
<p>"What does that matter, if you have seen her wash the second, or the
fiftieth?"</p>
<p>"I tell you brother she does not wash dishes, or do anything but look
after the business of the house, and take care of the plate, of which
there is a great deal."</p>
<p>"How is it, then, that throughout the whole city they call her the
illustrious scullery-maid, if so be she does not wash dishes? Perhaps it
is because she washes silver and not crockery that they give her that
name. But to drop this subject, tell me, Tomas, how stand your hopes?"</p>
<p>"In a state of perdition; for during the whole time you were in gaol, I
never have been able to say one word to her. It is true, that to all
that is said to her by the guests in the house, she makes no other reply
than to cast down her eyes and keep her lips closed; such is her virtue
and modesty; so that her modesty excites my love, no less than her
beauty. But it is almost too much for my patience, to think that the
corregidor's son, who is an impetuous and somewhat licentious youth, is
dying for her; a night seldom passes but he serenades her, and that so
openly, that she is actually named in the songs sung in her praise. She
never hears them to be sure, nor ever quits her mistress's room from the
time she retires until morning; but in spite of all that, my heart
cannot escape being pierced by the keen shaft of jealousy."</p>
<p>"What do you intend to do, then, with this Portia, this Minerva, this
new Penelope, who, under the form of a scullery-maid, has vanquished
your heart?"</p>
<p>"Her name is Costanza, not Portia, Minerva, or Penelope. That she is a
servant in an inn, I cannot deny; but what can I do, if, as it seems,
the occult force of destiny, and the deliberate choice of reason, both
impel me to adore her? Look you, friend, I cannot find words to tell you
how love exalts and glorifies in my eyes this humble scullery-maid, as
you call her, so that, though seeing her low condition, I am blind to
it, and knowing it, I ignore it. Try as I may, it is impossible for me
to keep it long before my eyes; for that thought is at once obliterated
by her beauty, her grace, her virtue, and modesty, which tell me that,
beneath that plebeian husk, must be concealed some kernel of
extraordinary worth. In short, be it what it may, I love her, and not
with that common-place love I have felt for others, but with a passion
so pure that it knows no wish beyond that of serving her, and prevailing
on her to love me, and return in the like kind what is due to my
honourable affection."</p>
<p>Here Lope gave a shout, and cried out in a declamatory tone, "O Platonic
love! O illustrious scullery-maid! O thrice-blessed age of ours, wherein
we see love renewing the marvels of the age of gold! O my poor tunnies,
you must pass this year without a visit from your impassioned admirer,
but next year be sure I will make amends, and you shall no longer find
me a truant."</p>
<p>"I see, Asturiano," said Tomas, "how openly you mock me. Why don't you
go to your fisheries? There is nothing to hinder you. I will remain
where I am, and you will find me here on your return. If you wish to
take your share of the money with you, take it at once; go your ways in
peace, and let each of us follow the course prescribed to him by his own
destiny."</p>
<p>"I thought you had more sense," said Lope. "Don't you know that I was
only joking? But now that I perceive you are in earnest, I will serve
you in earnest in everything I can do to please you. Only one thing I
entreat in return for the many I intend to do for you: do not expose me
to Argüello's persecution, for I would rather lose your friendship than
have to endure hers. Good God, friend! her tongue goes like the clapper
of a mill; you can smell her breath a league off; all her front teeth
are false, and it is my private opinion that she does not wear her own
hair, but a wig. To crown all, since she began to make overtures to me,
she has taken to painting white, till her face looks like nothing but a
mask of plaster."</p>
<p>"True, indeed, my poor comrade; she is worse even than the Gallegan who
makes me suffer martyrdom. I'll tell you what you shall do; only stay
this night in the inn, and to-morrow you shall buy yourself an ass, find
a lodging, and so secure yourself from the importunities of Argüello,
whilst I remain exposed to those of the Gallegan, and to the fire of my
Costanza's eyes."</p>
<p>This being agreed on, the two friends returned to the inn, where
Asturiano was received with great demonstrations of love by Argüello.
That night a great number of muleteers stopping in the house, and those
near it, got up a dance before the door of the Sevillano. Asturiano
played the guitar: the female dancers were the two Gallegans and
Argüello, and three girls from another inn. Many persons stood by as
spectators, with their faces muffled, prompted more by a desire to see
Costanza than the dance; but they were disappointed, for she did not
make her appearance. Asturiano played for the dancers with such spirit
and precision of touch that they all vowed he made the guitar speak; but
just as he was doing his best, accompanying the instrument with his
voice, and the dancers were capering like mad, one of the muffled
spectators cried out, "Stop, you drunken sot! hold your noise, wineskin,
piperly poet, miserable catgut scraper!" Several others followed up this
insulting speech with such a torrent of abuse that Lope thought it best
to cease playing and singing; but the muleteers took the interruption so
much amiss, that had it not been for the earnest endeavours of the
landlord to appease them, there would have been a terrible row. In spite
indeed of all he could do, the muleteers would not have kept their hands
quiet, had not the watch happened just then to come up and clear the
ground. A moment afterwards the ears of all who were awake in the
quarter were greeted by an admirable voice proceeding from a man who
had seated himself on a stone opposite the door of the Sevillano.
Everybody listened with rapt attention to his song, but none more so
than Tomas Pedro, to whom every word sounded like a sentence of
excommunication, for the romance ran thus:</p>

<p>The last line was immediately followed by the flight of two brick-bats,
which fell close to the singer's feet; but had they come in contact with
his head, they would certainly have knocked all the music and poetry out
of it. The poor frightened musician took to his heels with such speed
that a greyhound could not have caught him. Unhappy fate of
night-birds, to be always subject to such showers! All who had heard
the voice of the fugitive admired it, but most of all, Tomas Pedro, only
he would rather the words had not been addressed to Costanza, although
she had not heard one of them. The only person who found fault with the
romance was a muleteer, nicknamed Barrabas. As soon as this man saw the
singer run off, he bawled after him; "There you go, you Judas of a
troubadour! May the fleas eat your eyes out! Who the devil taught you to
sing to a scullery-maid about celestial realms, and spheres, and
ocean-beds, and to call her stars and suns and all the rest of it? If
you had told her she was as straight as asparagus, as white as milk, as
modest as a lay-brother in his novitiate, more full of humours and
unmanageable than a hired mule, and harder than a lump of dry mortar,
why then she would have understood you and been pleased; but your fine
words are fitter for a scholar than for a scullery-maid. Truly, there
are poets in the world who write songs that the devil himself could not
understand; for my part, at least, Barrabas though I am, I cannot make
head or tail of what this fellow has been singing. What did he suppose
Costanza could make of them? But she knows better than to listen to such
stuff, for she is snug in bed, and cares no more for all these
caterwaulers than she does for Prester John. This fellow at least, is
not one of the singers belonging to the corregidor's son, for they are
out and out good ones, and a body can generally understand them; but, by
the Lord, this fellow sets me mad."</p>
<p>The bystanders coincided in opinion with Barrabas, and thought his
criticism very judicious. Everybody now went to bed, but no sooner was
the house all still, than Lope heard some one calling very softly at his
bed-room door. "Who's there?" said he. "It is we," whispered a voice,
"Argüello and the Gallegan. Open the door and let us in, for we are
dying of cold."</p>
<p>"Dying of cold indeed," said Lope, "and we are in the middle of the dog
days."</p>
<p>"Oh, leave off now, friend Lope," said the Gallegan; "get up and open
the door; for here we are as fine as archduchesses."</p>
<p>"Archduchesses, and at this hour? I don't believe a word of it, but
rather think you must be witches or something worse. Get out of that
this moment, or, by all that's damnable, if you make me get up I'll
leather you with my belt till your hinder parts are as red as poppies."</p>
<p>Finding that he answered them so roughly, and in a manner so contrary to
their expectations, the two disappointed damsels returned sadly to their
beds; but before they left the door, Argüello put her lips to the
key-hole, and hissed through it, "Honey was not made for the mouth of
the ass;" and with that, as if she had said something very bitter
indeed, and taken adequate revenge on the scorner, she went off to her
cheerless bed.</p>
<p>"Look you, Tomas," said Lope to his companion, as soon as they were
gone, "set me to fight two giants, or to break the jaws of half a dozen,
or a whole dozen of lions, if it be requisite for your service, and I
shall do it as readily as I would drink a glass of wine; but that you
should put me under the necessity of encountering Argüello, this is what
I would never submit to, no, not if I were to be flayed alive. Only
think, what damsels of Denmark<a id="FNanchor_81_81"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-14.htm.html#Footnote_81_81" class="pginternal"><sup>[81]</sup></a> fate has thrown upon us this night.
Well, patience! To-morrow will come, thank God, and then we shall see."</p>
<p>"I have already told you, friend," replied Tomas, "that you may do as
you please—either go on your pilgrimage, or buy an ass and turn
water-carrier as you proposed."</p>
<p>"I stick to the water-carrying business," said Lope. "My mind is made up
not to quit you at present."</p>
<p>They then went to sleep till daylight, when they rose; Tomas Pedro went
to give out oats, and Lope set off to the cattle-market to buy an ass.
Now it happened that Tomas had spent his leisure on holidays in
composing some amorous verses, and had jotted them down in the book in
which he kept the account of the oats, intending to copy them out
fairly, and then blot them out of the book, or tear out the page. But,
before he had done so, he happened to go out one day and leave the book
on the top of the oat-bin. His master found it there, and looking into
it to see how the account of the oats stood, he lighted upon the verses.
Surprised and annoyed, he went off with them to his wife, but before he
read them to her, he called Costanza into the room, and peremptorily
commanded her to declare whether Tomas Pedro, the hostler, had over made
love to her, or addressed any improper language to her, or any that
gave token of his being partial to her. Costanza vowed that Tomas had
never yet spoken to her in any such way, nor ever given her reason to
suppose that he had any bad thoughts towards her.</p>
<p>Her master and mistress believed her, because they had always found her
to speak the truth. Having dismissed her, the host turned to his wife
and said, "I know not what to say of the matter. You must know, señora,
that Tomas has written in this book, in which he keeps the account of
the oats, verses that give me an ugly suspicion that he is in love with
Costanza."</p>
<p>"Let me see the verses," said the wife, "and I'll tell you what we are
to conclude."</p>
<p>"Oh, of course; as you are a poet you will at once see into his
thoughts."</p>
<p>"I am not a poet, but you well know that I am a woman of understanding,
and that I can say the four prayers in Latin."</p>
<p>"You would do better to say them in plain Spanish; you know your uncle
the priest has told you that you make no end of blunders when you patter
your Latin, and that what you say is good for nothing."</p>
<p>"That was an arrow from his niece's quiver. She is jealous of seeing me
take the Latin hours in hand, and make my way through them as easily as
through a vineyard after the vintage."</p>
<p>"Well, have it your own way. Listen now, here are the verses;" and he
read some impassioned lines addressed to Costanza.</p>
<p>"Is there any more?" said the landlady.</p>
<p>"No. But what do you think of these verses?"</p>
<p>"In the first place, we must make sure that they are by Tomas."</p>
<p>"Of that there can be no manner of doubt, for the handwriting is most
unquestionably the same as that in which the account of the oats is
kept."</p>
<p>"Look ye, husband, it appears to me that although Costanza is named in
the verses, whence it may be supposed that they were made for her, we
ought not for that reason to set the fact down for certain, just as if
we had seen them written, for there are other Costanzas in the world
besides ours. But even supposing they were meant for her, there is not a
word in them that could do her discredit. Let us be on the watch, and
look sharply after the girl; for if he is in love with her, we may be
sure he will make more verses, and try to give them to her."</p>
<p>"Would it not be better to get rid of all this bother by turning him out
of doors?"</p>
<p>"That is for you to do if you think proper. But really, by your own
account, the lad does his work so well that it would go against one's
conscience to turn him off upon such slight grounds."</p>
<p>"Very well; let us be on the watch as you say, and time will tell us
what we have to do." Here the conversation ended, and the landlord
carried the book back to the place where he had found it.</p>
<p>Tomas returned in great anxiety to look for his book, found it, and that
it might not occasion him another fright, he immediately copied out the
verses, effaced the original, and made up his mind to hazard a
declaration to Costanza upon the first opportunity that should present
itself. Her extreme reserve, however, was such that there seemed little
likelihood of his finding such an opportunity; besides, the great
concourse of people in the house made it almost impossible that he
should have any private conversation with her,—to the despair of her
unfortunate lover. That day, however, it chanced that Costanza appeared
with one cheek muffled, and told some one who asked her the reason, that
she was suffering from a violent face ache. Tomas, whose wits were
sharpened by his passion, instantly saw how he might avail himself of
that circumstance. "Señora Costanza," he said, "I will give you a prayer
in writing, which you have only to recite once or twice, and it will
take away your pain forthwith."</p>
<p>"Give it me, if you please," said Costanza, "and I will recite it; for I
know how to read."</p>
<p>"It must be on condition, however," said Tomas, "that you do not show it
to anybody; for I value it highly, and I should not wish it to lose its
charm by being made known to many."</p>
<p>"I promise you that no person shall see it; but let me have it at once,
for I can hardly bear this pain."</p>
<p>"I will write it out from memory, and bring it you immediately."</p>
<p>This was the very first conversation that had ever taken place between
Tomas and Costanza during all the time he had been in the house, which
was nearly a month. Tomas withdrew, wrote out the prayer, and found
means to deliver it, unseen by any one else, into Costanza's hand; and
she, with great eagerness, and no less devotion, went with it into a
room, where she shut herself up alone. Then, opening the paper, she read
as follows:—</p>
<p>"Lady of my soul, I am a gentleman of Burgos; and if I survive my
father, I shall inherit a property of six thousand ducats yearly income.
Upon the fame of your beauty, which spreads far and wide, I left my
native place, changed my dress, and came in the garb in which you see
me, to serve your master. If you would consent to be mine in the way
most accordant with your virtue, put me to any proof you please, to
convince you of my truth and sincerity; and when you have fully
satisfied yourself in this respect, I will, if you consent, become your
husband, and the happiest of men. For the present, I only entreat you
not to turn such loving and guileless feelings as mine into the street;
for if your master, who has no conception of them, should come to know
my aspirations, he would condemn me to exile from your presence, and
that would be the same thing as sentencing me to death. Suffer me,
señora, to see you until you believe me, considering that he does not
deserve the rigorous punishment of being deprived of the sight of you,
whose only fault has been that he adores you. You can reply to me with
your eyes, unperceived by any of the numbers who are always gazing upon
you; for your eyes are such that their anger kills, but their compassion
gives new life."</p>
<p>When Tomas saw that Costanza had gone away to read his letter, he
remained with a palpitating heart, fearing and hoping either his
death-doom, or the one look that should bid him live. Presently Costanza
returned, looking so beautiful in spite of her muffling, that if any
extraneous cause could have heightened her loveliness, it might be
supposed that her surprise at finding the contents of the paper so
widely different from what she had expected, had produced that effect.
In her hand she held the paper torn into small pieces, and returning,
the fragments to Tomas, whose legs could hardly bear him up, "Brother
Tomas," she said, "this prayer of yours seems to me to savour more of
witchcraft and delusion than of piety, therefore I do not choose to put
faith in it or to use it, and I have torn it up that it may not be seen
by any one more credulous than myself. Learn other prayers, for it is
impossible that this one can ever do you any good."</p>
<p>So saying, she returned to her mistress's room, leaving Tomas sorely
distressed, but somewhat comforted at finding that his secret remained
safe confined to Costanza's bosom; for as she had not divulged it to her
master, he reckoned that at least he was in no danger of being turned
out of doors. He considered also, that in having taken the first step,
he had overcome mountains of difficulties, for in great and doubtful
enterprises the chief difficulty is always in the beginning.</p>
<p>Whilst these things were happening in the posada, Asturiano was going
about the market in search of an ass. He examined a great many, but did
not find one to his mind; though a gipsy tried hard to force upon him
one that moved briskly enough, but more from the effects of some
quicksilver which the vendor had put into the animal's ears, than from
its natural spirit and nimbleness. But though the pace was good enough,
Lope was not satisfied with the size, for he wanted an ass big and
strong enough to carry himself and the water vessels, whether they were
full or empty. At last a young fellow came up, and whispered in his ear,
"If you want a beast of the right sort for a water-carrier's business, I
have one close by in a meadow; a bigger or a better you will not find in
Toledo. Take my advice, and never buy a gipsy's beast, for though they
may seem sound and good, they are all shams, and full of hidden defects.
If you want to buy the real thing, come along with me, and shut your
mouth."</p>
<p>Lope consented, and away went the pair shoulder to shoulder, till they
arrived at the King's Gardens, where they found several water-carriers
seated under the shade of a water wheel, whilst their asses were grazing
in an adjoining meadow. The vendor pointed out his ass, which took
Lope's fancy immediately, and was praised by all present, as a very
strong animal, a good goer, and a capital feeder. The bargain was soon
struck, and Lope gave sixteen ducats for the ass, with all its
accoutrements. The bystanders congratulated him on his purchase, and on
his entrance into the business, assuring him that he had bought an
exceedingly lucky ass, for the man who had sold him had, in less than a
year, without over-working himself, made enough to buy two suits of
clothes, over and above his own keep, and that of the ass, and the
sixteen ducats, with which he intended to return to his native place,
where a marriage had been arranged with a half kinswoman of his. Besides
the water-carriers who assisted at the sale of the ass, there was a
group of four stretched on the ground, and playing at primera, the earth
serving them for a table, and their cloaks for a table cloth. Lope went
up to watch their game, and saw that they played more like archdeacons
than like water-carriers, each of them having before him a pile of more
than a hundred reals in cuartos and in silver. Presently two of the
players, having lost all they had, got up; whereupon the seller of the
ass said, that, if there was a fourth hand, he would play, but he did
not like a three-handed game.</p>
<p>Lope, who never liked to spoil sport, said that he would make a fourth.
They sat down at once, and went at it so roundly that, in a few moments,
Lope lost six crowns which he had about him, and finding himself without
coin, said if they liked to play for the ass he would stake him. The
proposal was agreed to, and he staked one quarter of the ass, saying
they should play for him, quarter by quarter. His luck was so bad, that
in four consecutive games he lost the four quarters of his ass, and they
were won by the very man who had sold him. The winner got up to take
possession, but Lope stopped him, observing that he had only played for
and lost the four quarters of his ass, which the winner was welcome to
take, but he must leave him the tail. This queer demand made all present
shout with laughter; and some of them, who were knowing in the law, were
of opinion that his claim was unreasonable, for when a sheep or any
other beast is sold, the tail is never separated from the carcass, but
goes as a matter of course with one of the hind quarters. To this Lope
replied that in Barbary they always reckon five quarters to a sheep, the
tail making the fifth, and being reckoned as valuable as any of the
other quarters. He admitted that when a beast was sold alive, and not
quartered, that the tail was included in the sale; but this was not to
the point in question, for he had not sold his ass, but played it away,
and it had never been his intention to stake the tail; therefore he
required them forthwith to give him up the same, with everything thereto
annexed, or pertaining, that is to say, the whole series of spinal
bones, from the back of the skull to where they ended in the tail, and
to the tips of the lowest hairs thereof.</p>
<p>"Well," said one, "suppose it be as you say, and that your claim is
allowed; leave the tail sticking to the rest of the ass, and hold on by
it."</p>
<p>"No," said Lope, "give me up the tail, or all the water-carriers in the
world shall never make me give up the ass. Don't imagine because there
are so many of you, that I will let you put any cheating tricks on me,
for I am a man who can stand up to another man, and put two handbreadths
of cold steel into his guts without his being able to tell how he came
by them. Moreover, I won't be paid in money for the tail at so much a
pound, but I will have it in substance, and cut off from the ass, as I
have said."</p>
<p>The winner of the four quarters and the rest of the company began to
think that it would not be advisable to resort to force in this
business, for Lope seemed to them to be a man of such mettle, that he
would not be vanquished without some trouble. Nor were they mistaken;
for, as became a man who had spent three seasons at the tunny fisheries,
where all sorts of rows and brawls are familiar things, he rattled out a
few of the most out of the way oaths in vogue there, threw his cap into
the air, whipped out a knife from beneath his cloak, and put himself
into such a posture as struck the whole company with awe and respect. At
last, one of them, who seemed the most rational, induced the rest to
agree that Lope should be allowed to stake the tail against a quarter of
the ass at a game of <i>quinola</i>. So said, so done. Lope won the first
game; the loser was piqued and staked another quarter, which went the
way of the first; and in two more games the whole ass was gone. He then
proposed to play for money: Lope was unwilling, but was so importuned on
all hands, that at last he consented; and such was his run of luck that
he left his opponent without a maravedi. So intense was the loser's
vexation, that he rolled and writhed upon the ground and knocked his
head against it. Lope, however, like a good-natured, liberal gentleman,
raised him up, returned all the money he had won, including the sixteen
ducats the price of the ass, and even divided what he had left among the
bystanders. Great was the surprise of them all at this extraordinary
liberality; and had they lived in the time of the great Tamerlane, they
would have made him king of the water-carriers.</p>
<p>Accompanied by a great retinue, Lope returned to the city, where he
related his adventure to Tomas, who in turn recounted to him his own
partial success. There was no tavern, or eating house, or rogues'
gathering, in which the play for the ass was not known, the dispute
about the tail, and the high spirit and liberality of the Asturian; but
as the mob are for the most part unjust, and more prone to evil than to
good, they thought nothing of the generosity and high mettle of the
great Lope, but only of the tail; and he had scarcely been two days
carrying water about the city, before he found himself pointed at by
people who cried, "There goes the man of the tail!" The boys caught up
the cry, and no sooner had Lope shown himself in any street, than it
rang from one end to the other with shouts of "Asturiano, give up the
tail! Give up the tail, Asturiano!" At first Lope said not a word,
thinking that his silence would tire out his persecutors; but in this he
was mistaken, for the more he held his tongue the more the boys wagged
theirs, till at last he lost patience, and getting off his ass began to
drub the boys; but this was only cutting off the heads of Hydra, and for
every one he laid low by thrashing some boy, there sprang up on the
instant, not seven but seven hundred more, that began to pester him more
and more for the tail. At last he found it expedient to retire to the
lodgings he had taken apart from his companion in order to avoid
Argüello, and to keep close there until the influence of the malignant
planet which then ruled the hours should have passed away, and the boys
should have forgotten to ask him for the tail. For two days he never
left the house except by night to go and see Tomas, and ask him how he
got on. Tomas told him that since he had given the paper to Costanza he
had never been able to speak a single word to her, and that she seemed
to be more reserved than ever. Once he had found as he thought an
opportunity to accost her, but before he could get out a word, she
stopped him, saying, "Tomas, I am in no pain now, and therefore have no
need of your words or of your prayers. Be content that I do not accuse
you to the Inquisition, and give yourself no further trouble." But she
made this declaration without any expression of anger in her
countenance. Lope then related how the boys annoyed him, calling after
him for the tail, and Tomas advised him not to go abroad, at least with
his ass, or if he did that he should choose only the least frequented
streets. If that was not enough, he had an unfailing remedy left, which
was to get rid of his business and with it of the uncivil demand to
which it subjected him. Lope asked him had the Gallegan come again to
his room. He said she had not, but that she persisted in trying to
ingratiate herself with him by means of dainties which she purloined out
of what she cooked for the guests. After this conversation Lope went
back to his lodgings, intending not to leave them again for another six
days, at least in company with his ass.</p>
<p>It might be about eleven at night, when the corregidor most unexpectedly
entered the Posado del Sevillano, at the head of a formidable posse. The
host and even the guests were startled and agitated by his visit; for as
comets, when they appear, always excite fears of disaster, just so the
ministers of justice, when they suddenly enter a house, strike even
guiltless consciences with alarm. The unwelcome visitor walked into a
room, and called for the master of the house, who came tremblingly to
know what might be the señor corregidor's pleasure. "Are you the
landlord?" said the magistrate with great gravity. "Yes, señor, and your
worship's humble servant to command," was the reply. The corregidor then
ordered that every one else should quit the room, and leave him alone
with the landlord. This being done, he resumed his questions.</p>
<p>"What servants have you in your inn, landlord?"</p>
<p>"Señor, I have two Gallegan wenches, a housekeeper, and a young man who
gives out the oats and straw, and keeps the reckoning."</p>
<p>"No more?"</p>
<p>"No, señor."</p>
<p>"Then tell me, landlord, what is become of a girl who is said to be a
servant in this house, and so beautiful that she is known all over this
city as the illustrious scullery-maid? It has even reached my ears that
my son Don Perequito is in love with her, and that not a night passes in
which he does not serenade her."</p>
<p>"Señor, it is true that this illustrious scullery-maid, as they call
her, is in my house, but she neither is my servant, nor ceases to be
so."</p>
<p>"I do not understand you. What do you mean by saying that she is and is
not your servant?"</p>
<p>"It is the real truth, and if your worship will allow me, I will explain
the matter to you, and tell you what I have never told to any one."</p>
<p>"Before I hear what you have to say, I must first see this
scullery-maid."</p>
<p>Upon this the landlord went to the door and called to his wife to send
in Costanza, When the landlady heard that, she was in great dismay, and
began to wring her hands, saying, "Lord, have mercy on me! What can the
corregidor want with Costanza, and alone! Some terrible calamity must
surely have happened, for this girl's beauty bewitches the men."</p>
<p>"Don't be alarmed, señora," said Costanza, "I will go and see what the
señor corregidor wants, and if anything bad has happened, be assured the
fault is not mine;" and without waiting to be called a second time, she
took a lighted candle in a silver candlestick, and went into the room
where the corregidor was. As soon as he saw her, he bade the landlord
shut the door, and then taking the candle out of her hand; and holding
it near her face, he stood gazing at her from head to foot. The blush
which this called up into Costanza's cheeks, made her look so beautiful
and so modest that it seemed to the corregidor he beheld an angel
descended on earth. After a long scrutiny, "Landlord," he said, "an inn
is not fit setting for a jewel like this, and I now declare that my son
Don Perequito has shown his good sense in fixing his affections so
worthily. I say, damsel, that they may well call you not only
illustrious, but most illustrious: but it should not be with the
addition of scullery-maid, but with that of duchess."</p>
<p>"She is no scullery-maid, señor," said the host; "her only service in
the house is to keep the keys of the plate, of which, by God's bounty, I
have some quantity for the service of the honourable guests who come to
this inn."</p>
<p>"Be that as it may, landlord," returned the corregidor; "I say it is
neither seemly nor proper that this damsel should live in an inn. Is she
a relation of yours?"</p>
<p>"She is neither my relation nor my servant; and if your worship would
like to know who she is, your worship shall hear, when she is not
present, things that will both please and surprise you."</p>
<p>"I should like to know it. Let Costanza retire, and be assured she may
count on me in all things, as she would upon her own father; for her
great modesty and beauty oblige all who see her to offer themselves for
her service."</p>
<p>Costanza replied not a word, but with great composure made a profound
reverence to the corregidor. On leaving the room she found her mistress
waiting in great agitation. She told her all that had passed, and how
her master remained with the corregidor to tell some things, she knew
not what, which he did not choose her to hear. All this did not quite
tranquilise the landlady, nor did she entirely recover her equanimity
until the corregidor went away, and she saw her husband safe and free.
The latter meanwhile had told the corregidor the following tale:—</p>
<p>"It is now, by my reckoning, señor, fifteen years, one month, and four
days, since there came to this house a lady dressed in the habit of a
pilgrim, and carried in a litter. She was attended by four servant-men
on horseback, and two dueñas and a damsel who rode in a coach. She had
also two sumpter mules richly caparisoned, and carrying a fine bed and
all the necessary implements for cooking. In short, the whole equipage
was first rate, and the pilgrim had all the appearance of being some
great lady; and though she seemed to be about forty years of age, she
was nevertheless beautiful in the extreme. She was in bad health, looked
pale, and was so weary, that she ordered her bed to be instantly made,
and her servants made it in this very room. They asked me who was the
most famous physician in this city. I said Doctor de la Fuente. They
went for him instantly; he came without delay, saw his patient alone,
and the result was that he ordered the bed to be made in some other part
of the house, where the lady might not be disturbed by any noise, which
was immediately done. None of the men-servants entered the lady's
apartment, but only the two dueñas and the damsel. My wife and I asked
the men-servants who was this lady, what was her name, whence she came,
and whither she was going? Was she wife, widow, or maid, and why she
wore that pilgrim's dress? To all these questions, which we repeated
many and many a time, we got no other answer than that this pilgrim was
a noble and wealthy lady of old Castile, that she was a widow, and had
no children to inherit her wealth; and that having been for some months
ill of the dropsy, she had made a vow to go on a pilgrimage to our Lady
of Guadalupe, and that was the reason for the dress she wore. As for her
name, they were under orders to call her nothing but the lady pilgrim.</p>
<p>"So much we learned then; but three days after one of the dueñas called
myself and my wife into the lady's presence, and there, with the door
locked, and before her women, she addressed us with tears in her eyes, I
believe in these very words:—</p>
<p>"'Heaven is my witness, friends, that without any fault of mine, I find
myself in the cruel predicament which I shall now declare to you. I am
pregnant, and so near my time, that I already feel the pangs of travail.
None of my men-servants are aware of my misfortune, but from my women
here I have neither been able nor desirous to conceal it. To escape
prying eyes in my own neighbourhood, and that this hour might not come
upon me there, I made a vow to go to our Lady of Guadalupe; but it is
plainly her will that my labour should befal me in your house. It is now
for you to succour and aid me with the secrecy due to one who commits
her honour to your hands. In this purse there are two hundred gold
crowns, which I present to you as a first proof how grateful I shall be
for the good offices I am sure you will render me;' and taking from
under her pillow a green silk purse, embroidered with gold, she put it
into the hands of my wife, who, like a simpleton, stood gaping at the
lady, and did not say so much as a word in the way of thanks or
acknowledgment. For my part I remember that I said there was no need at
all of that, we were not persons to be moved more by interest than by
humanity to do a good deed when the occasion offered. The lady then
continued, 'You must immediately, my friends, look out for some place to
which you may convey my child as soon as it is born, and also you must
contrive some story to tell to the person in whose charge you will leave
it. At first I wish the babe to remain in this city, and afterwards to
be taken to a village. As for what is subsequently done, I will give you
instructions on my return from Guadalupe, if it is God's will that I
should live to complete my pilgrimage, for in the meantime I shall have
had leisure to consider what may be my best course. I shall have no need
of a midwife; for as I know from other confinements of mine, more
honourable than this, I shall do well enough with the aid of my women
only, and thus I shall avoid having an additional witness to my
misfortune.'</p>
<p>"Here the poor distressed pilgrim ended what she had to say, and broke
out into a flood of tears, but was partly composed by the soothing words
spoken to her by my wife, who had recovered her wits. I immediately went
in search of a woman to whom I might take the child when it was born;
and, between twelve and one o'clock that night, when all the people in
the house were fast asleep, the lady was delivered of the most beautiful
little girl that eyes ever beheld, and the very same that your worship
has just seen. But the wonder was that neither did the mother make any
moan in her labour, nor did the baby cry; but all passed off quietly,
and in all the silence that became this extraordinary case. The lady
kept her bed for six days, during which the doctor was constant in his
visits; not that she had informed him of the cause of her illness, or
that she took any of the medicines he prescribed; but she thought to
blind her men-servants by his visits, as she afterwards informed me when
she was out of danger. On the eighth day she left her bed, apparently as
big as she had been before her delivery, continued her pilgrimage, and
returned in three weeks, looking almost quite well, for she had
gradually reduced the bulk of her artificial dropsy. The little girl had
been christened Costanza, in accordance with the order given me by her
mother, and was already placed with a nurse in a village about two
leagues hence, where she passed for my niece. The lady was pleased to
express her satisfaction with all I had done, and gave me when she was
going away a gold chain, which is now in my possession, from which she
took off six links, telling me that they would be brought by the person
who should come to claim the child. She also took a piece of white
parchment, wrote upon it, and then cut zigzag through what she had
written. Look, sir, here are my hands locked together with the fingers
interwoven. Now suppose your honour were to write across my fingers, it
is easy to imagine that one could read the writing whilst the fingers
were joined, but that the meaning would be lost as soon as the hands
were separated, and would appear again as soon as they were united as
before. Just so with the parchment; one half serves as a key to the
other; when they are put together the letters make sense, but separately
they have no meaning. One-half of the parchment and the whole chain,
short of the six links, were left with me, and I keep them still, always
expecting the arrival of the person who is to produce the counterparts;
for the lady told me that in two years she would send for her daughter,
charging me that I should have her brought up not as became her mother's
quality, but as a simple villager; and if by any chance she was not able
to send for the child so soon, I was on no account to acquaint her with
the secret of her birth, even should she have arrived at years of
discretion. The lady moreover begged me to excuse her if she did not
tell me who she was; having for the present important reasons to conceal
her name. Finally, after giving us four hundred gold crowns more, and
embracing my wife with tears, she departed, leaving us filled with
admiration for her discretion, worth, beauty, and modesty.</p>
<p>"Costanza remained at nurse in the village for two years. At the end of
that time I brought her home, and have kept her ever since constantly
with me, in the dress of a girl who had to work for her bread, as her
mother directed. Fifteen years, one month, and four days I have been
looking for the person who should come and claim her, but the length of
time that has elapsed makes me begin to lose all hope of his coming. If
he does not make his appearance before this year is out, it is my
determination to adopt her and bequeath her all I am worth, which is
upwards of sixteen thousand ducats, thanks be to God. It now remains for
me, señor Corregidor, to enumerate to you the virtues and good qualities
of Costanza, if it be possible for me to express them. First and
foremost, she is most piously devoted to our Lady; she confesses and
communicates every month; she can read and write; there's not a better
lace maker in all Toledo; she sings without accompaniment like an angel;
in the matter of behaving with propriety she has not her equal; as for
her beauty, your worship has seen it with your own eyes. Señor Don
Pedro, your worship's son, has never exchanged a word with her in her
life. It is true that from time to time he treats her to some music,
which she never listens to. Many señors, and men of title too, have put
up at this house, and have delayed their journey for several days solely
to have their fill of looking at her; but I well know there is not one
of them can boast with truth that she ever gave them opportunity to say
one word to her either alone or before folk. This, señor, is the real
history of the illustrious scullery-maid, who is no scullion, in which I
have not departed one tittle from the truth."</p>
<p>The host had long ended his narrative before the corregidor broke
silence, so much was he struck by the strange facts he had heard. At
last he desired to see the parchment and the chain; the host produced
them without delay, and they corresponded exactly to the description he
had given of them. The chain was of curious workmanship, and on the
parchment were written, one under the other, on the projecting portions
of the zigzag, the letters, TIITEREOE which manifestly required to be
joined with those of the counterpart to make sense. The corregidor
admired the ingenuity of the contrivance, and judged from the costliness
of the chain, that the pilgrim must have been a lady of great wealth. It
was his intention to remove the lovely girl from the inn as soon as he
had chosen a suitable convent for her abode; but for the present he
contented himself with taking away the parchment only, desiring the
innkeeper to inform him if any one came for Costanza, before he showed
that person the chain, which he left in his custody. And with this
parting injunction the corregidor left the house, much marvelling at
what he had seen and heard.</p>
<p>Whilst all this affair was going on, Tomas was almost beside himself
with agitation and alarm, and lost in a thousand conjectures, every one
of which he dismissed as improbable the moment it was formed. But when
he saw the corregidor go away, leaving Costanza behind him, his spirits
revived and he began to recover his self-possession. He did not venture
to question the landlord, nor did the latter say a word about what had
passed between him and the corregidor to any body but his wife, who was
greatly relieved thereby, and thanked God for her delivery out of a
terrible fright.</p>
<p>About one o'clock on the following day, there came to the inn two
elderly cavaliers of venerable presence, attended by four servants on
horseback and two on foot. Having inquired if that was the Posada del
Sevillano, and being answered in the affirmative, they entered the
gateway, and the four mounted servants, dismounting, first helped their
master's out of their saddles. Costanza came out to meet the new-comers
with her wonted propriety of demeanour, and no sooner had one of the
cavaliers set eyes on her, than, turning to his companion, he said, "I
believe, señor Don Juan, we have already found the very thing we are
come in quest of." Tomas, who had come as usual to take charge of the
horses and mules, instantly recognised two of his father's servants; a
moment after he saw his father himself, and found that his companion was
no other than the father of Carriazo. He instantly conjectured that they
were both on their way to the tunny fisheries to look for himself and
his friend, some one having no doubt told them that it was there, and
not in Flanders, they would find their sons. Not daring to appear before
his father in the garb he wore, he made a bold venture, passed by the
party with his hand before his face, and went to look for Costanza,
whom, by great good luck, he found alone. Then hurriedly, and with a
tremulous voice, dreading lest she would not give him time to say a word
to her, "Costanza," he said, "one of those two elderly cavaliers is my
father—that one whom you will hear called Don Juan de Avendaño. Inquire
of his servants if he has a son, Don Tomas de Avendaño by name, and that
is myself. Thence you may go on to make such other inquiries as will
satisfy you that I have told you the truth respecting my quality, and
that I will keep my word with regard to every offer I have made you. And
now farewell, for I will not return to this house until they have left
it."</p>
<p>Costanza made him no reply, nor did he wait for any, but hurrying out,
with his face concealed as he had come in, he went to acquaint Carriazo
that their fathers had arrived at the Sevillano. The landlord called for
Tomas to give out oats, but no Tomas appearing, he had to do it himself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one of the two cavaliers called one of the Gallegan wenches
aside, and asked her what was the name of the beautiful girl he had
seen, and was she a relation of the landlord or the landlady. "The
girl's name is Costanza," replied the Gallegan; "she is no relation
either to the landlord or the landlady, nor do I know what she is. All I
can say is, I wish the murrain had her, for I don't know what there is
about her, that she does not leave one of us girls in the house a single
chance, for all we have our own features too, such as God made them.
Nobody enters these doors but the first thing he does is to ask, Who is
that beautiful girl? and the next is to say all sorts of flattering
things of her, while nobody condescends to say a word to the rest of us,
not so much as 'What are you doing here, devils, or women, or whatever
you are?'"</p>
<p>"From your account, then," said the gentleman, "I suppose she has a fine
time of it with the strangers who put up at this house."</p>
<p>"You think so. Well, just you hold her foot for the shoeing, and see how
you'll like the job. By the Lord, señor, if she would only give her
admirers leave to look at her, she might roll in gold; but she's more
touch-me-not than a hedgehog; she's a devourer of Ave Marias, and spends
the whole day at her needle and her prayers. I wish I was as sure of a
good legacy as she is of working miracles some day. Bless you, she's a
downright saint; my mistress says she wears hair-cloth next her skin."</p>
<p>Highly delighted with what he had heard from the Gallegan, the gentleman
did not wait till they had taken off his spurs, but called for the
landlord, and withdrew with him into a private room. "Señor host," said
he, "I am come to redeem a pledge of mine which has been in your hands
for some years, and I bring you for it a thousand gold crowns, these
links of a chain, and this parchment."</p>
<p>The host instantly recognised the links and the parchment, and highly
delighted with the promise of the thousand crowns, replied, "Señor, the
pledge you wish to redeem is in this house, but not the chain or the
parchment which is to prove the truth of your claim; I pray you
therefore to have patience, and I will return immediately." So saying,
he ran off to inform the corregidor of what was happening.</p>
<p>The corregidor, who had just done dinner, mounted his horse without
delay, and rode to the Posada del Sevillano, taking with him the tally
parchment. No sooner had he entered the room where the two cavaliers
sat, than hastening with open arms to embrace one of them, "Bless my
soul! my good cousin Don Juan de Avendaño! This is indeed a welcome
surprise."</p>
<p>"I am delighted to see you, my good cousin," said Don Juan, "and to
find you as well as I always wish you. Embrace this gentleman, cousin;
this is Don Diego de Carriazo, a great señor and my friend."</p>
<p>"I am already acquainted with the señor Don Diego," replied the
corregidor, "and am his most obedient servant."</p>
<p>After a further interchange of civilities they passed into another room,
where they remained alone with the innkeeper, who said as he produced
the chain, "The señor corregidor knows what you are come for, Don Diego
de Carriazo. Be pleased to produce the links that are wanting to this
chain; his worship will show the parchment which he holds, and let us
come to the proof for which I have been so long waiting."</p>
<p>"It appears, then," said Don Diego, "that it will not be necessary to
explain to the señor corregidor the reason of our coming, since you have
done so already, señor landlord."</p>
<p>"He told me something," said the corregidor, "but he has left much
untold which I long to know. Here is the parchment."</p>
<p>Don Diego produced that which he had brought; the two were put together
and found to fit accurately into each other; and between every two
letters of the innkeeper's portion, which as we have said were TIITEREOE
there now appeared one of the following series HSSHTUTKN, the whole
making together the words, <i>This is the true token</i>. The six links of
the chain brought by Don Diego were then compared with the larger
fragment, and found to correspond exactly.</p>
<p>"So far all is clear," said the corregidor; "it now remains for us to
discover, if it be possible, who are the parents of this very beautiful
lady."</p>
<p>"Her father," said Don Diego, "you see in me; her mother is not living,
and you must be content with knowing that she was a lady of such rank
that I might have been her servant. But though I conceal her name, I
would not have you suppose that she was in any wise culpable, however
manifest and avowed her fault may appear to have been. The story I will
now briefly relate to you will completely exonerate her memory.</p>
<p>"You must know, then, that Costanza's mother, being left a widow by a
man of high rank, retired to an estate of hers, where she lived a calm
sequestered life among her servants and vassals. It chanced one day
when I was hunting, that I found myself very near her house and
determined to pay her a visit. It was siesta time when I arrived at her
palace (for I can call it nothing else): giving my horse to one of my
servants, I entered, and saw no one till I was in the very room in which
she lay asleep on a black ottoman. She was extremely handsome; the
silence, the loneliness of the place, and the opportunity, awakened my
guilty desires, and without pausing to reflect, I locked the door, woke
her, and holding her firmly in my grasp said, 'No cries, señora! they
would only serve to proclaim your dishonour; no one has seen me enter
this room, for by good fortune all your servants are fast asleep, and
should your cries bring them hither, they can do no more than kill me in
your very arms; and if they do, your reputation will not be the less
blighted for all that.' In fine, I effected my purpose against her will
and by main force, and left her so stupefied by the calamity that had
befallen her, that she either could not or would not utter one word to
me. Quitting the place as I had entered it, I rode to the house of one
of my friends, who resided within two leagues of my victim's abode. The
lady subsequently removed to another residence, and two years passed
without my seeing her, or making any attempt to do so. At the end, of
that time I heard that she was dead.</p>
<p>"About three weeks since I received a letter from a man who had been the
deceased lady's steward, earnestly entreating me to come to him, as he
had something to communicate to me which deeply concerned my happiness
and honour. I went to him, very far from dreaming of any such thing as I
was about to hear from him, and found him at the point of death. He told
me in brief terms that his lady on her deathbed had made known to him
what had happened between her and me, how she had become pregnant, had
made a pilgrimage to our Lady of Guadalupe to conceal her misfortune,
and had been delivered in this inn of a daughter named Costanza. The man
gave me the tokens upon which she was to be delivered to me, namely the
piece of chain and the parchment, and with them thirty thousand gold
crowns, which the lady had left as a marriage portion for her daughter.
At the same time, he told me that it was the temptation to appropriate
that money which had so long prevented him from obeying the dying
behest of his mistress, but now that he was about to be called to the
great account, he was eager to relieve his conscience by giving me up
the money and putting me in the way to find my daughter. Returning home
with the money and the tokens, I related the whole story to Don Juan de
Avendaño, and he has been kind enough to accompany me to this city."</p>
<p>Don Diego had but just finished his narrative when some one was heard
shouting at the street-door, "Tell Tomas Pedro, the hostler, that they
are taking his friend the Asturiano to prison." On hearing this the
corregidor immediately sent orders to the alguazil to bring in his
prisoner, which was forthwith done. In came the Asturian with his mouth
all bloody. He had evidently been very roughly handled, and was held
with no tender grasp by the alguazil. The moment he entered the room he
was thunderstruck at beholding his own father and Avendaño's, and to
escape recognition he covered his face with a handkerchief, under
pretence of wiping away the blood. The corregidor inquired what that
young man had done who appeared to have been so roughly handed. The
alguazil replied that he was a water-carrier, known by the name of the
Asturian, and the boys in the street used to shout after him, "Give up
the tail, Asturiano; give up the tail." The alguazil then related the
story out of which that cry had grown, whereat all present laughed not a
little. The alguazil further stated that as the Asturian was going out
at the Puerta de Alcantara, the boys who followed him having redoubled
their cries about the tail, he dismounted from his ass, laid about them
all, and left one of them half dead with the beating he had given him.
Thereupon the officer proceeded to arrest him; he resisted, and that was
how he came to be in the state in which he then appeared. The corregidor
ordered the prisoner to uncover his face, but as he delayed to do so the
alguazil snatched away the handkerchief. "My son, Don Diego!" cried the
astonished father. "What is the meaning of all this? How came you in
that dress? What, you have not yet left off your scampish tricks?"
Carriazo fell on his knees before his father, who, with tears in his
eyes, held him long in his embrace. Don Juan de Avendaño, knowing that
his son had accompanied Carriazo, asked the latter where he was, and
received for answer the news that Don Tomas de Avendaño was the person
who gave out the oats and straw in that inn.</p>
<p>This new revelation made by the Asturiano put the climax to the
surprises of the day. The corregidor desired the innkeeper to bring in
his hostler. "I believe he is not in the house, but I will go look for
him," said he, and he left the room for that purpose. Don Diego asked
Carriazo what was the meaning of these metamorphoses, and what had
induced him to turn water-carrier, and Don Tomas hostler? Carriazo
replied, that he could not answer these questions in public, but he
would do so in private. Meanwhile Tomas Pedro lay hid in his room, in
order to see thence, without being himself seen, what his father and
Carriazo's were doing; but he was in great perplexity about the arrival
of the corregidor, and the general commotion in the inn. At last some
one having told the landlord where he was hidden, he went and tried half
by fair means and half by force to bring him down; but he would not have
succeeded had not the corregidor himself gone out into the yard, and
called him by his own name, saying, "Come down, señor kinsman; you will
find neither bears nor lions in your way." Tomas then left his hiding
place, and went and knelt with downcast eyes and great submission at the
feet of his father, who embraced him with a joy surpassing that of the
Prodigal's father when the son who had been lost was found again.</p>
<p>The corregidor sent for Costanza, and taking her by the hand, presented
her to her father, saying, "Receive, Señor Don Diego, this treasure, and
esteem it the richest you could desire. And you, beautiful maiden, kiss
your father's hand, and give thanks to heaven which has so happily
exalted your low estate." Costanza, who till that moment had not even
guessed at what was occurring, could only fall at her father's feet, all
trembling with emotion, clasp his hands in hers, and cover them with
kisses and tears.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the corregidor had been urgent with his cousin Don Juan that
the whole party should come with him to his house; and though Don Juan
would have declined the invitation, the corregidor was so pressing that
he carried his point, and the whole party got into his coach, which he
had previously sent for. But when the corregidor bade Costanza take her
place in it, her heart sank within her; she threw herself into the
landlady's arms, and wept so piteously, that the hearts of all the
beholders were moved. "What is this, daughter of my soul?" said the
hostess; "Going to leave me? Can you part from her who has reared you
with the love of a mother?" Costanza was no less averse to the
separation; but the tenderhearted corregidor declared that the hostess
also should enter the coach, and that she should not be parted from her
whom she regarded as a daughter, as long as she remained in Toledo. So
the whole party, including the hostess, set out together for the
corregidor's house, where they were well received by his noble lady.</p>
<p>After they had enjoyed a sumptuous repast, Carriazo related to his
father how, for love of Costanza, Don Tomas had taken service as hostler
in the inn, and how his devotion to her was such that, before he knew
her to be a lady, and the daughter of a man of such quality, he would
gladly have married her even as a scullery-maid. The wife of the
corregidor immediately made Costanza put on clothes belonging to a
daughter of hers of the same age and figure, and if she had been
beautiful in the dress of a working girl, she seemed heavenly in that of
a lady, and she wore it with such ease and grace that one would have
supposed she had never been used to any other kind of costume from her
birth. But among so many who rejoiced, there was one person who was full
of sadness, and that was Don Pedro, the corregidor's son, who at once
concluded that Costanza was not to be his; nor was he mistaken, for it
was arranged between the corregidor, Don Diego de Carriazo, and Don Juan
de Avendaño, that Don Tomas should marry Costanza, her father bestowing
upon her the thirty thousand crowns left by her mother; that the
water-carrier Don Diego de Carriazo should marry the daughter of the
corregidor, and that Don Pedro the corregidor's son, should receive the
hand of Don Juan de Avendaño's daughter, his father undertaking to
obtain a dispensation with regard to their relationship. In this manner
all were finally made happy. The news of the three marriages, and of the
singular fortune of the illustrious scullery-maid, spread through the
city, and multitudes flocked to see Costanza in her new garb as a lady,
which became her so well. These persons saw the hostler Tomas Pedro
changed into Don Tomas de Avendaño, and dressed as a man of quality.
They observed, too, that Lope Asturiano looked very much the gentleman
since he had changed his costume, and dismissed the ass and the
water-vessels; nevertheless, there were not wanting some who, as he
passed through the streets in all his pomp, still called out to him for
the tail.</p>
<p>After remaining a month in Toledo most of the party went to Burgos,
namely, Don Diego de Carriazo, his wife, and his father; Costanza, and
her husband, Don Tomas, and the corregidor's son, who desired to visit
his kinswoman and destined bride. The host was enriched by the present
of the thousand crowns, and by the many jewels which Costanza bestowed
upon her señora, as she persisted in calling her who had brought her up.
The story of the illustrious scullery-maid afforded the poets of the
golden Tagus a theme on which to exercise their pens in celebrating the
incomparable beauty of Costanza, who still lives happily with her
faithful hostler. Carriazo has three sons, who, without inheriting their
father's tastes, or caring to know whether or not there are any such
things as tunny fisheries in the world, are all pursuing their studies
at Salamanca; whilst their father never sees a water-carrier's ass but
he thinks of the one he drove in Toledo, and is not without apprehension
that, when he least expects it, his ears shall be saluted with some
squib having for its burden, "Give us the tail, Asturiano! Asturiano,
give us the tail!"</p>
