<body class="x-ebookmaker x-ebookmaker-2"><p>"The people of the inn came up and found I had been struck by four balls
and several slugs, but none of the wounds in any vital part. Calling for
a confessor, I received all the sacraments as became a Catholic
Christian; but I gradually recovered, though it was two months before I
was able to continue my journey. I then proceeded to Genoa, but found no
other means of passage than two feluccas, which were hired by myself and
two Spanish gentlemen. One of them we employed to go before and pilot
the way, and in the other we ourselves embarked. In this way we pursued
our voyage, closely hugging the shore; but when we came to a spot on the
coast of France, called the Three Marias, two Turkish galleys suddenly
came out upon us from a creek, and one keeping to seaward of us, the
other more in shore, they cut off our escape to the land and captured
us. The corsairs stripped us to the skin, plundered the feluccas, and
having completely emptied them, let them drift ashore, instead of
sinking them, saying that they might serve to bring them more pickings
another time.</p>
<p>"You may well believe how bitterly I felt my captivity, and above all,
the loss of the certificates from Rome, which I carried in a tin case,
with the bill for the sixteen hundred ducats; but, by good fortune, they
fell into the hands of a Christian slave, a Spaniard, who kept them, for
if the Turks had got hold of them, they would have required for my
ransom at least the amount of the bill. They carried us to Algiers,
where I found that the fathers of the Most Holy Trinity were redeeming
Christian slaves. I spoke to them, told them who I was, and they, moved
by charity, ransomed me, though I was a foreigner. The price set upon me
was three hundred ducats; they paid down one hundred on the spot, and
engaged to pay the remaining two hundred as soon as the ship should
return with the contributions for the release of the Redemptorist father
who remained in Algiers in pledge for four thousand ducats, which he had
spent over and above the amount he had brought in hand; for so extreme
is the charity of these compassionate fathers, that they give their
liberty for another's, and remain in captivity that others may go free.
In addition to the happiness of obtaining my liberty, I recovered the
case with the certificates and the bill. I showed its contents to the
good father, and promised him five hundred ducats, in addition to the
amount of my ransom, as a contribution towards the payment of the sum
for which he was a hostage.</p>
<p>"It was nearly a year before the ship returned with the redemption
money. What befel me in that year would, of itself, furnish matter for
another history too long to relate at present. I will only say, that I
was recognised by one of the twenty Turks whom I liberated with the
Christians on the occasion already mentioned; but he was so grateful and
so honest, that he would not betray me, for had the Turks known me to be
the person who had sunk two of their galleys, and despoiled them of the
great Indian galleon, they would either have put me to death, or
presented me to the Grand Turk, in which case I should never have
recovered my liberty. Finally, the Redemptorist father came to Spain
with me, and fifty other ransomed Christians. We made a general
procession in Valentia, and from that place we dispersed and took each
his own several way, wearing this garb in token of the means by which we
had been released. For myself, I arrived to-day in this city, burning
with desire to see Isabella, my betrothed, and asked my way at once to
the convent, where I was to hear of her. What happened there you all
know. It now only remains for me to exhibit these certificates to
satisfy you of the truth of my strange story."</p>
<p>So saying, he produced the documents from a tin case, and placed them in
the hands of the vicar-general, who examined them along with the chief
justice, and found nothing in them to make him doubt the truth of what
Richard had stated. Moreover, for the fuller confirmation of his story,
Heaven ordained that among the persons present should be that very
Florentine merchant on whom the bill for sixteen hundred ducats was
drawn. He asked to see it, found it genuine, and accepted it on the
spot, for he had received advice of it several months before. Thereupon
Richard confirmed the promise he had made of contributing five hundred
ducats to the funds of the Redemptorist fathers. The chief justice
embraced him, Isabella, and her parents, and complimented them all in
the most courteous terms. So, too, did the vicar-general, who requested
Isabella to commit this whole story to writing, that he might lay it
before his superior, the archbishop, and this she promised to do.</p>
<p>The deep silence in which the audience had listened to this
extraordinary narrative was broken by thanksgivings to God for his great
marvels; and all present, from the highest to the lowest, congratulated
Isabella, Richard, and their parents, and prayed for their happiness as
they took leave of them. Eight days afterwards, Richard and Isabella
were united before the altar, their marriage being honoured by the
presence of the chief justice, and all the persons of distinction in
Seville. Thus, after so many vicissitudes, Isabella's parents recovered
their daughter, and re-established their fortune; and she, favoured by
heaven, and aided by her many virtues, in spite of so many crosses and
troubles, obtained for her husband a man so deserving as Richard, with
whom it is believed that she lives to this day, in the house facing
Santa Paula, which her father had hired, and which they subsequently
bought of the heirs of a gentleman of Burgos, named Hernando Cifuentes.</p>
<p>This tale may teach us what virtue and what beauty can effect, since
they are sufficient together, or either singly, to win the love even of
enemies; and how Heaven is able to bring forth our greatest happiness
even out of our heaviest misfortunes.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00015"><a id="THE_FORCE_OF_BLOOD"/>THE FORCE OF BLOOD.</h2>
<p>One night, after a sultry summer's day, an old hidalgo of Toledo walked
out to take the air by the river's side, along with his wife, his little
boy, his daughter aged sixteen, and a female servant. Eleven o'clock had
struck: it was a fine clear night: they were the only persons on the
road; and they sauntered leisurely along, to avoid paying the price of
fatigue for the recreation provided for the Toledans in their valley or
on the banks of their river. Secure as he thought in the careful
administration of justice in that city, and the character of its
well-disposed inhabitants, the good hidalgo was far from thinking that
any disaster could befal his family. But as misfortunes commonly happen
when they are least looked for, so it chanced with this family, who were
that night visited, in the midst of their innocent enjoyment, by a
calamity which gave them cause to weep for many a year.</p>
<p>There was in that city a young cavalier, about two-and-twenty years of
age, whom wealth, high birth, a wayward disposition, inordinate
indulgence, and profligate companions impelled to do things which
disgraced his rank. This young cavalier—whose real name we shall, for
good reasons, conceal under that of Rodolfo—was abroad that night with
four of his companions, insolent young roisterers like himself, and
happened to be coming down a hill as the old hidalgo and his family were
ascending it. The two parties, the sheep and the wolves, met each other.
Rodolfo and his companions, with their faces muffled in their cloaks,
stared rudely and insolently at the mother, the daughter, and the
servant-maid. The old hidalgo indignantly remonstrated; they answered
him with mocks and jeers, and passed on. But Rodolfo had been struck by
the great beauty of Leocadia, the hidalgo's daughter, and presently he
began to entertain the idea of enjoying it at all hazards. In a moment
he communicated his thoughts to his companions, and in the next moment
they resolved to turn back and carry her off to please Rodolfo; for the
rich who are open-handed always find parasites ready to encourage their
bad propensities; and thus to conceive this wicked design, to
communicate it, approve it, resolve on ravishing Leocadia, and to carry
that design into effect was the work of a moment.</p>
<p>They drew their swords, hid their faces in the flaps of their cloaks,
turned back, and soon came in front of the little party, who had not yet
done giving thanks to God for their escape from those audacious men.
Rodolfo laid hold on Leocadia, caught her up in his arms, and ran off
with her, whilst she was so overcome with surprise and terror, that far
from being able to defend herself or cry out, she had not even sense or
sight left to see her ravisher, or know whither he was carrying her. Her
father shouted, her mother shrieked, her little brother cried, the
servant-maid tore her own face and hair; but the shouts and shrieks were
disregarded, the wailings moved no pity, the clawing and scratching was
of no avail; for all was lost upon the loneliness of the spot, the
silence of the night, and the cruel hearts of the ravishers. Finally,
the one party went off exulting, and the other was left in desolation
and woe.</p>
<p>Rodolfo arrived at his own house without any impediment, and Leocadia's
parents reached theirs heart-broken and despairing. They were afraid to
appeal for justice to the laws, lest thereby they should only publish
their daughter's disgrace; besides, though well born they were poor, and
had not the means of commanding influence and favour; and above all,
they knew not the name of their injurer, or of whom or what to complain
but their luckless stars. Meanwhile Rodolfo had Leocadia safe in his
custody, and in his own apartment. It was in a wing of his father's
house, of which he had the keys, a great imprudence on the part of any
parent. When Leocadia fainted in his arms, he had bandaged her eyes, in
order that she might not notice the streets through which she passed, or
the house into which he took her; and before she recovered her senses,
he effected his guilty purpose.</p>
<p>Apathy and disgust commonly follow satiated lust. Rodolfo was now
impatient to get rid of Leocadia, and made up his mind to lay her in
the street, insensible as she was. He had set to work with that
intention, when she came to herself, saying, "Where am I? Woe is me!
What darkness is this? Am I in the limbo of my innocence, or the hell of
my sins? Who touches me? Am I in bed? Mother! dear father! do you hear
me? Alas, too well I perceive that you cannot hear me, and that I am in
the hands of enemies. Well would it be for me if this darkness were to
last for ever, and my eyes were never more to see the light! Whoever
thou art," She exclaimed, suddenly seizing Rodolfo's hand, "if thy soul
is capable of pity, grant me one prayer: having deprived me of honour,
now deprive me of life. Let me not survive my disgrace! In mercy kill me
this moment! It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have
done me."</p>
<p>Confused by the vehemence of her reproaches, Rodolfo knew not what to
say or do, and answered not a word. This silence so astonished Leocadia,
that she began to fancy she was dreaming, or haunted by a phantom; but
the hands she grasped were of flesh and blood. She remembered the
violence with which she had been torn from her parents, and she became
but too well aware of the real nature of her calamity. After a
passionate burst of tears and groans, "Inhuman youth!" she continued,
"for your deeds assure me that your years are few, I will forgive the
outrage you have done me, on the sole condition that you promise and vow
to conceal your crime in perpetual silence, as profound as this darkness
in which you have perpetrated it. This is but a small recompense for so
grievous a wrong; but it is the greatest which I can ask, or you can
grant me. I have never seen your face, nor ever desire to see it. It is
enough for me to remember the injury I have sustained, without having
before my mind's eye the image of my ravisher. My complaints shall be
addressed only to Heaven: I would not have them heard by the world,
which judges not according to the circumstances of each case, but
according to its own preconceived notions. You may wonder to hear me
speak thus, being so young. I am surprised at it myself; and I perceive
that if great sorrows are sometimes dumb, they are sometimes eloquent.
Be this as it may, grant me the favour I implore: it will cost you
little. Put me at once into the street, or at least near the great
church; for I shall know my way thence to the house of my parents. But
you must also swear not to follow me, or make any attempts to ascertain
my name or that of my family, who if they were as wealthy as they are
noble, would not have to bear patiently such insult in my person. Answer
me, and if you are afraid of being known by your voice, know, that
except my father and my confessor, I have never spoken with any man in
my life, and that I should never be able to tell who you were, though
you were to speak ever so long."</p>
<p>The only reply Rodolfo made to the unhappy Leocadia was to embrace her,
and attempt a repetition of his offence; but she defended herself with
hands, feet, and teeth, and with a strength he could not have supposed
her capable of exerting. "Base villain," she cried, "you took an
infamous advantage of me when I had no more power to resist than a stock
or a stone; but now that I have recovered my senses, you shall kill me
before you shall succeed. You shall not have reason to imagine, from my
weak resistance, that I pretended only to faint when you effected my
ruin." In fine, she defended herself with such spirit and vigour as
completely damped Rodolfo's ardour. Without saying a word he left the
room, locked the door behind him, and went in quest of his companions,
to consult them as to what he should do.</p>
<p>Finding herself left alone, Leocadia got out of bed, and groped about
the room, and along the walls, feeling for a door or window through
which she might make her escape. She found the door, but it was locked
outside. She succeeded in opening the window; and the moonlight shone in
so brightly, that she could distinguish the colour of some damask
hangings in the room. She saw that the bed was gilded, and so rich, that
it seemed that of a prince rather than of a private gentleman. She
counted the chairs and the cabinets, observed the position of the door,
and also perceived some pictures hanging on the walls, but was not able
to distinguish the subjects. The window was large, and protected by a
stout iron grating: it looked out on a garden, surrounded by high walls,
so that escape in that direction was as impossible as by the door.</p>
<p>Everything she observed in this sumptuous apartment showed her that its
master was a person of quality, and of extraordinary wealth. Among other
things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver,
standing on a cabinet near the window. She took it, and hid it in the
sleeve of her gown, not out of devotion, nor yet with a felonious
intention, but with a very proper and judicious design. Having done
this, she shut the window as before, and returned to the bed, to see
what would be the end of an affair which had begun so badly. In about
half an hour, as it seemed to her, the door was opened; some one came
in, blindfolded her, and taking her by the arm, without a word spoken,
led her out of the room, which she heard him lock behind him.</p>
<p>This person was Rodolfo, who though he had gone to look for his friends,
had changed his mind in that respect, not thinking it advisable to
acquaint them with what had passed between him and the girl. On the
contrary, he resolved to tell them, that repenting of his violence, and
moved by her tears, he had only carried her half-way towards his house,
and then let her go. Having come to this resolution, he hastened back to
remove Leocadia before daylight appeared, which would compel him to keep
her in his room all the following day. He led her then to the Plaza del
Ayuntamiento, and there, in a feigned voice, speaking half Portuguese
and half Spanish, he told her she might go home without fear, for she
should not be followed; and he was already out of sight before she had
taken the bandage from her eyes.</p>
<p>Leocadia looked all round her: she was quite alone: no one was in sight;
but suspecting that she might be followed at a distance, she stopped
every now and then on her way home, which was not far, and looked behind
her. To baffle any spies that might perchance be watching her, she
entered a house which she found open; and by and by she went from it to
her own, where she found her parents stupefied with grief. They had not
undressed, or thought of taking any rest. When they saw her, they ran to
her with open arms, and welcomed her with tears. Choking with emotion,
Leocadi made a sign to her parents that she wished to be alone with
them. They retired with her, and she gave them a succinct account of all
that had befallen her. She described the room in which she had been
robbed of her honour, the window, the grating, the garden, the cabinets,
the bed, the damask hangings, and, last of all, she showed them the
crucifix which she had carried off, and before which the three innocent
victims renewed their tears, imprecated Heaven's vengeance on the
insolent ravisher, and prayed that he might be miraculously punished.
She told her parents, that although she had no wish to know the name of
him at whose hands she had received such cruel wrong, yet if they
thought fit to make such a discovery, they might do so by means of the
crucifix, by directing the sacristans of the several parishes in the
city to announce from the pulpits that whoever had lost such an image
would find it in the hands of a certain monk whom he should name. By
this means, they would discover their enemy in the person of the owner
of the crucifix.</p>
<p>"That would be very well, my child," replied her father, "if your plan
were not liable to be frustrated by ordinary cunning; but no doubt this
image has been already missed by its owner, and he will have set it down
for certain that it was taken out of the room by the person he locked up
there. To give him notice that the crucifix was in the hands of a
certain monk would only serve to make known the person who deposited it
in such keeping, but not to make the owner declare himself; for the
latter might send another person for it, and furnish him with all the
particulars by which he should identify it. Thus you see we should only
damage ourselves without obtaining the information we sought; though to
be sure we might employ the same artifice on our side, and deposit the
image with the monk through a third hand. What you had best do, my
child, is to keep it, and pray to it, that since it was a witness to
your undoing, it will deign to vindicate your cause by its righteous
judgment. Bear in mind, my child, that an ounce of public dishonour
outweighs a quintal of secret infamy; and since, by the blessing of God,
you can live in honour before the public eye, let it not distress you so
much to be dishonoured in your ownself in secret. Real dishonour
consists in sin, and real honour in virtue. There are three ways of
offending God; by thought, word, and deed; but since neither in thought,
nor in word, nor in deed have you offended, look upon yourself as a
person of unsullied honour, as I shall always do, who will never cease
to regard you with the affection of a father."</p>
<p>Thus did this humane and right-minded father comfort his unhappy
daughter; and her mother embracing her again did all she could to soothe
her feelings. In spite of all their tenderness her anguish was too
poignant to be soon allayed; and from that fatal night, she continued to
live the life of a recluse under the protection of her parents.</p>
<p>Rodolfo meanwhile having returned home, and having missed the crucifix,
guessed who had taken it, but gave himself no concern about it. To a
person of his wealth such a loss was of no importance; nor did his
parents make any inquiry about it, when three days afterwards, on his
departure for Italy, one of his mother's women took an inventory of all
the effects he left in his apartment. Rodolfo had long contemplated a
visit to Italy; and his father, who himself had been there, encouraged
him in that design, telling him that no one could be a finished
gentleman without seeing foreign countries. For this and other reasons,
Rodolfo readily complied with the wishes of his father, who gave him
ample letters of credit on Barcelona, Genoa, Rome, and Naples. Taking
with him two of his companions, he set out on his travels, with
expectations raised to a high pitch, by what he had been told by some
soldiers of his acquaintance, concerning the good cheer in the
hostelries of Italy and France, and the free and easy life enjoyed by
the Spaniards in their quarters. His ears were tickled with the sound of
such phrases as these: <i>ecco li buoni polastri</i>, <i>picioni</i>, <i>presuto</i>,
<i>salcicie</i>, and all the other fine things of the sort, which soldiers
are fond of calling to mind when they return from those parts to Spain.
In fine, he went away with as little thought or concern about what had
passed between him and the beautiful Leocadia as though it had never
happened. She meanwhile passed her life with her parents in the
strictest retirement, never letting herself be seen, but shunning every
eye lest it should read her misfortune in her face. What she had thus
done voluntarily at first, she found herself, in a few months,
constrained to do by necessity; for she discovered that she was
pregnant, to the grievous renewal of her affliction.</p>
<p>Time rolled on: the hour of her delivery arrived: it took place in the
utmost secrecy, her mother taking upon her the office of midwife: and
she gave birth to a son, one of the most beautiful ever seen. The babe
was conveyed, with the same secrecy, to a village, where he remained
till he was four years old, when his grandfather brought him, under the
name of nephew, to his own house, where he was reared, if not in
affluence, at least most virtuously. The boy, who was named Luis after
his grandfather, was remarkably handsome, of a sweet docile disposition;
and his manners and deportment, even at that tender age, were such as
showed him to be the son of some noble father. His grandfather and
grandmother were so delighted with his grace, beauty, and good
behaviour, that they came at last to regard their daughter's mischance
as a happy event, since it had given them such a grandson. When the boy
walked through the streets, blessings were showered upon him by all who
saw him—blessings upon his beauty, upon the mother that bore him, upon
the father that begot him, upon those who brought him up so well. Thus
admired by strangers, as well as by all who knew him, he grew up to the
age of seven, by which time he could already read Latin and his mother
tongue, and write a good round hand; for it was the intention of his
grandparents to make him learned and virtuous, since they could not make
him rich, learning and virtue being such wealth as thieves cannot steal,
or fortune destroy.</p>
<p>One day, when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a
relation, he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse
of horsemen. He stopped to look at them; and to see them the better, he
moved from his position, and crossed the street. In doing so, he was not
rapid enough to avoid a fiery horse, which its rider could not pull up
in time, and which knocked Luis down, and trampled upon him. The poor
child lay senseless on the ground, bleeding profusely from his head. A
moment after the accident had happened, an elderly gentleman threw
himself from his horse with surprising agility, took the boy out of the
arms of a person who had raised him from the ground, and carried him to
his own house, bidding his servants go fetch a surgeon.</p>
<p>Many gentlemen followed him, greatly distressed at the sad accident
which had befallen the general favourite; for it was soon on everybody's
lips that the sufferer was little Luis. The news speedily reached the
ears of his grandparents and his supposed cousin, who all hurried in
wild dismay to look for their darling. The gentleman who had humanely
taken charge of him being of eminent rank, and well known, they easily
found their way to his house, and arrived there just as Luis was under
the surgeon's hands. The master and mistress begged them not to cry, or
raise their voices in lamentation; for it would do the little patient no
good. The surgeon, who was an able man, having dressed the wound with
great care and skill, saw that it was not so deadly as he had at first
supposed. In the midst of the dressing, Luis came to his senses, and was
glad to see his relations, who asked him how he felt. "Pretty well," he
said, only his head and his body pained him a good deal. The surgeon
desired them not to talk to him, but leave him to repose. They did so,
and the grandfather then addressed himself to the master of the house,
thanking him for the kindness he had shown to his nephew. The gentleman
replied that there was nothing to thank him for; the fact being, that
when he saw the boy knocked down, his first thought was that he saw
under the horses' heels the face of a son of his own, whom he tenderly
loved. It was this that impelled him to take the boy up, and carry him
to his own house, where he should remain all the time he was in the
surgeon's hands, and be treated with all possible care. The lady of the
house spoke to the same effect, and with no less kindness and
cordiality.</p>
<p>The grandfather and grandmother were surprised at meeting with so much
sympathy on the part of strangers; but far greater was the surprise of
their daughter, who, on looking round her, after the surgeon's report
had somewhat allayed her agitation, plainly perceived that she was in
the very room to which she had been carried by her ravisher. The damask
hangings were no longer there; but she recognised it by other tokens.
She saw the grated window that opened on the garden: it was then closed
on account of the little patient; but she asked if there was a garden on
the outside, and was answered in the affirmative. The bed she too well
remembered was there; and, above all, the cabinet, on which had stood
the image she had taken away, was still on the same spot. Finally, to
corroborate all the other indications, and confirm the truth of her
discovery beyond all question, she counted the steps of the staircase
leading from the room to the street, and found the number exactly what
she had expected; for she had had the presence of mind to count them on
the former occasion, when she descended them blindfold. On her return
home, she imparted her discovery to her mother, who immediately made
inquiries as to whether the gentleman in whose house her grandson lay
ever had a son. She found he had one son, Rodolfo—as we call him—who
was then in Italy; and on comparing the time he was said to have been
abroad with that which had elapsed since her daughter's ravishment, she
found them to agree very closely. She made all this known to her
husband; and it was finally settled between the three that they should
not move in the matter for the present, but wait till the will of Heaven
had declared itself respecting the little patient.</p>
<p>Luis was out of danger in a fortnight; in a month he rose from his bed;
and during all that time he was visited daily by his mother and
grandmother, and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if
he was their own child. Doña Estafania, the kind gentleman's wife, often
observed, in conversation with Leocadia, that the boy so strongly
resembled a son of hers who was in Italy, she never could look at him
without thinking her son was actually before her. One day, when Doña
Estafania repeated this remark, no one being present but herself and
Leocadia, the latter thought it a good opportunity to open her mind to
the lady, in the manner previously concerted between herself and her
parents.</p>
<p>"Señora," she said, "when my parents heard of the terrible accident that
had befallen their nephew, they felt as if the sky had fallen upon their
heads. For them it was losing the light of their eyes, and the staff of
their age, to lose their nephew, their love for whom far surpasses that
which parents commonly bear towards their sons. But, as the proverb
says, with the disease God sends the remedy. The boy found his recovery
in this house; and I found in it reminiscences of events I shall never
forget as long as I live. I, señora, am noble, for so are my parents,
and so were all my ancestors, who, though but moderately endowed with
the gifts of fortune, always happily maintained their honour where-ever
they lived."</p>
<p>Doña Estafania listened attentively to Leocadia, and was astonished to
hear her speak with an intelligence beyond her years, for she did not
think her more than twenty; and without interrupting her by a single
word, she heard her relate her whole story, how she had been forcibly
carried into that chamber, what had been done to her there, and by what
tokens she had been able to recognise it again. In confirmation of all
this, she drew forth from her bosom the crucifix she had taken away with
her, and thus addressed it: "Lord, who wast witness of the violence done
to me, be thou the judge of the amends which are my due. I took thee
from off this cabinet, that I might continually remind thee of my wrong,
not in order to pray to thee for vengeance, which I do not invoke, but
to beseech thee to inspire me with some counsel which may enable me to
bear it with patience." Then turning to Doña Estafania, "This boy,
señora," she said, "towards whom you have manifested the extreme of your
great kindness and compassion, is your own grandson. It was by the
merciful providence of Heaven that he was run over, in order that being
taken to your house, I should find him in it, as I hope to find there,
if not the remedy most appropriate to my misfortune, at least the means
of alleviating it." Thus saying, and pressing the crucifix to her
breast, she fell fainting into the arms of Doña Estafania, who as a
gentlewoman, to whose sex pity is as natural as cruelty is to man,
instantly pressed her lips to those of the fainting girl, shedding over
her so many tears that there needed no other sprinkling of water to
recover Leocadia from her swoon.</p>
<p>Whilst the two were in this situation, Doña Estafania's husband entered
the room, leading little Luis by the hand. On seeing his wife all in
tears, and Leocadia fainting, he eagerly inquired the cause of so
startling a spectacle. The boy having embraced his mother, calling her
his cousin, and his grandmother, calling her his benefactress, repeated
his grandfather's question. "I have great things to tell you, señor,"
said Doña Estafania to her husband, "the cream and substance of which is
this: the fainting girl before you is your daughter, and that boy is
your grandson. This truth which I have learned from her lips is
confirmed by his face, in which we have both beheld that of our son."</p>
<p>"Unless you speak more fully, señora, I cannot understand you," replied
her husband.</p>
<p>Just then Leocadia came to herself, and embracing the cross seemed
changed into a sea of tears, and the gentleman remained in utter
bewilderment, until his wife had repeated to him, from beginning to end,
Leocadia's whole story; and he believed it, through the blessed
dispensation of Heaven, which had confirmed it by so many convincing
testimonies. He embraced and comforted Leocadia, kissed his grandson,
and that same day he despatched a courier to Naples, with a letter to
his son, requiring him to come home instantly, for his mother and he had
concluded a suitable match for him with a very beautiful lady. They
would not allow Leocadia and her son to return any more to the house of
her parents, who, overjoyed at her good fortune, gave thanks for it to
Heaven with all their hearts.</p>
<p>The courier arrived at Naples; and Rodolfo, eager to become possessed of
so beautiful a wife as his father had described, took advantage of the
opportunity offered by four galleys which were ready to sail for Spain;
and two days after the receipt of the letter he embarked with his two
comrades, who were still with him. After a prosperous run of twelve
days, he reached Barcelona, whence he posted in seven to Toledo, and
entered his father's house, dressed in the very extreme of fashionable
bravery. His parents were beyond measure rejoiced at his safe arrival,
after so long an absence; and Leocadia was filled with indescribable
emotions, as she beheld him, herself unseen, from a secret place in
which she had been stationed by Doña Estafania's contrivance. Rodolfo's
two comrades proposed to take leave of him at once, and retire to their
own homes; but Estafania would not suffer them to depart, for their
presence was needful for the execution of a scheme she had in her head.</p>
<p>It was nearly night when Rodolfo arrived; and whilst preparations were
making for supper, Estafania took her son's companions aside, believing
that they were two of the three whom Leocadia mentioned as having been
with Rodolfo on the night of her abduction. She earnestly entreated them
to tell her, if they remembered that her son had carried off a young
woman, on such a night, so many years ago; for the honour and the peace
of mind of all his relations depended on their knowing the truth of that
matter. So persuasive were her entreaties, and so strong her assurances
that no harm whatever could result to them from the information she
sought, they were induced to confess that one summer's night, the same
she had mentioned, themselves and another friend being out on a stroll
with Rodolfo, they had been concerned in the abduction of a girl whom
Rodolfo carried off, whilst the rest of them detained her family, who
made a great outcry, and would have defended her if they could. They
added that Rodolfo told them, on the following day, that he had carried
the girl to his own apartment; and this was all they knew of the matter.</p>
<p>All doubts which could possibly have remained on the case having been
removed by this confession, Estafania determined to pursue her scheme.
Shortly before supper she took her son in private into a room, where she
put the portrait of a lady into his hands, saying, "Here is something to
give you an appetite for your supper, Rodolfo; this is the portrait of
your bride; but I must tell you that what she wants in beauty is more
than made up for in virtue. She is of good family, and tolerably
wealthy; and since your father and I have made choice of her, you may be
assured she will suit you very well."</p>
<p>"Well," said Rodolfo, staring at the portrait, "if the painter of this
portrait has flattered the original as much as painters usually do, then
beyond all doubt the lady must be the very incarnation of ugliness.
Truly, my lady mother, if it is just and right that sons should obey
their parents in all things, it is no less proper that parents should
have regard to the inclinations of their sons; and since matrimony is a
bond not to be loosed till death, they ought to take care that it shall
press as smoothly and equably as possible. Virtue, good birth, prudence,
and the gifts of fortune, are all very good things, and may well gladden
the heart of whoever may have the lot to obtain this lady for a wife;
but that her ugliness can ever gladden the eyes of her spouse, appears
to me an impossibility. I am a bachelor to be sure, but I perfectly
comprehend the coincidence there should be between the sacrament of
marriage and the just and due delight mutually enjoyed by the married
pair, and that if that be wanting, the object of marriage is frustrated;
for to imagine that an ugly face which one must have before his eyes at
all hours, in the hall, at table, and in bed, I say once more that is
impossible. For God's sake, my lady mother, give me a wife who would be
an agreeable companion, not one who will disgust me, so that we may both
bear evenly, and with mutual good-will, the yoke imposed on us by
Heaven, instead of pulling this way and that way, and fretting each
other to death. If this lady is well-born, discreet, and rich as you
say, she will easily find a husband of a different humour from mine.
Some look for noble blood in a wife, some for understanding, others for
money, and others again for beauty, and of the latter class I am one. As
for high birth, thank Heaven and my ancestors I am well enough off in
that respect; as for understanding, provided a woman is neither a dolt
nor a simpleton, there is no need of her having a very subtle wit; in
point of wealth, I am amply provided by my parents; but beauty is what I
covet, with no other addition than virtue and good breeding. If my wife
brings me this, I will thank Heaven for the gift, and make my parents
happy in their old age."</p>
<p>Estafania was delighted to hear Rodolfo speak thus, for the sentiments
he expressed were just such as best accorded with the success of the
scheme she had in hand. She told him that she would endeavour to marry
him in conformity with his inclination, and that he need not make
himself uneasy, for there would be no difficulty in breaking off the
match which seemed so distasteful to him. Rodolfo thanked her, and
supper being ready they went to join the rest of the party at table. The
father and mother, Rodolfo and his two companions had already seated
themselves, when Doña Estafania said, in an off-hand way, "Sinner that I
am, how well I behave to my guest! Go," she said to a servant, "and ask
the señora. Doña Leocadia to honour our table with her presence, and
tell her she need not stand on any punctilio, for all here are my sons
and her servants." All this was part of her scheme, with the whole of
which Leocadia had been previously made acquainted.</p>
<p>The lady soon appeared, presenting a most charming spectacle of perfect
beauty, set off by the most appropriate adornments. The season being
winter, she was dressed in a robe and train of black velvet, with gold
and pearl buttons; her girdle and necklace were of diamonds; her head
was uncovered, and the shining braids and ringlets of her thick chestnut
hair, spangled with diamonds, dazzled the eyes of the beholders. Her
bearing was graceful and animated; she led her son by the hand, and
before her walked two maids with wax-lights and silver candlesticks. All
rose to do her reverence, as if something from heaven had miraculously
appeared before them; but gazing on her, entranced with admiration, not
one of them was able to address a single word to her. Leocadia bowed to
them all with courteous dignity, and Estafania taking her by the hand
led her to a seat next herself and opposite to Rodolfo, whilst the boy
was seated beside his grandfather. "Ah," said Rodolfo to himself, as he
gazed on the lovely being before him, "could I find but half that beauty
in the wife my mother has chosen for me, I should think myself the
happiest man in the world. Good God! what is it I behold? Is it some
angel in human shape that sits before me?" Whilst his eyes were thus
making his soul captive to the lovely image of Leocadia, she, on the
other hand, finding herself so near to him who was dearer to her than
the light of those eyes with which she furtively glanced at him from
time to time, began to revolve in her mind what had passed between her
and Rodolfo. The hopes her mother had given her of being his wife began
to droop, and the fear came strong upon her that such bliss was not for
one so luckless as herself. She reflected how near she stood to the
crisis which was to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy
for ever, and racked by the intensity of her emotions, she suddenly
changed colour, her head dropped, and she fell forward in a swoon into
the arms of the dismayed Estafania.</p>
<p>The whole party sprang up in alarm and hastened to her assistance, but
no one showed more earnest sympathy than Rodolfo, who fell twice in his
haste to reach her. They unlaced her, and sprinkled her face with cold
water; but far from coming to her senses, the fulness of her congested
bosom, her total insensibility, and the absence of all pulse gave such
mortal indications, that the servants began imprudently to cry out that
she was dead. This shocking news reached the ears of her parents, whom
Doña Estafania had concealed in another room that they might make their
appearance at the right moment. They now rushed into the supper room,
and the parish priest, who was also with them, went up to the prostrate
lady to see if she could by any signs make known that she repented of
her sins in order that he might give her absolution; but instead of one
fainting person he found two, for Rodolfo lay with his face on
Leocadia's bosom. His mother had left her to him as being her destined
protector; but when she saw that he too was insensible, she was near
making a third, and would have done so had he not come to himself. He
was greatly confused at finding that he had betrayed such emotion; but
his mother, who guessed his thoughts, said to him, "Do not be ashamed,
my son, at having been so overcome by your feelings; you would have been
so still more had you known what I will no longer conceal from you,
though I had intended to reserve it for a more joyful occasion. Know
then, son of my heart, that this fainting lady is your real bride: I say
real, because she is the one whom your father and I have chosen for you,
and the portrait was a pretence."</p>
<p>When Rodolfo heard this, carried away by the vehemence of his passion,
and on the strength of his title as a bridegroom disdaining all
conventional proprieties, he clasped Leocadia in his arms, and with his
lips pressed to hers, seemed as if he was waiting for her soul to issue
forth that he might absorb and mingle it with his own. Just at the
moment when the tears of the pitying beholders flowed fastest, and their
ejaculations were most expressive of despair, Leocadia gave signs of
recovery, and brought back gladness to the hearts of all. When she came
to her senses, and, blushing to find herself in Rodolfo's arms, would
have disengaged herself, "No, señora," he said, "that must not be;
strive not to withdraw from the arms of him who holds you in his soul."
There needed no more than these words to complete her revival; and Doña
Estafania having no further need of stratagem, requested the priest to
marry her son to Leocadia on the spot. This was done; for the event took
place at a time when the consent of the parties was sufficient for the
celebration of a marriage, without any of the preliminary formalities
which are now so properly required. I leave it to a more ingenious pen
than mine to describe the gladness of all present; the embraces bestowed
on Rodolfo by Leocadia's parents; the thanks they offered to Heaven, and
to his father and mother; the congratulations on both sides; the
astonishment of Rodolfo's companions who saw him so unexpectedly married
to so charming a bride on the very night of his arrival; and above all,
when they learned from the statement openly made by Doña Estafania,
that Leocadia was the very person whose abduction her son had effected
with their aid. Nor was Rodolfo less surprised than they; and the better
to assure himself of so wonderful a fact, he begged Leocadia to give him
some token which should make perfectly clear to him that which indeed he
did not doubt, since it was authenticated by his parents.</p>
<p>"Once when I recovered from a swoon," replied Leocadia, "I found myself,
señor, in your arms without honour; but for that I have had full
compensation, since on my recovery from my this day's swoon I found
myself in the same arms, but honoured. If this is not enough for you,
let it suffice to mention a crucifix which no one could have purloined
from you but myself, if it be true that you missed it in the morning,
and that it is the same that is now in the hands of your mother, my
lady."</p>
<p>"You are mine, the lady of my soul, and shall be so as long as God
grants me life," cried Rodolfo; embracing her again, amidst a fresh
shower of benedictions and congratulations from the rest of the party.</p>
<p>At last they sat down to a merry supper to the sound of music, for the
performers, who had been previously engaged, were now arrived. Rodolfo
saw his own likeness in his son's face as in a mirror. The four
grandparents wept for joy: there was not a corner of the house but was
full of gladness; and though night was hurrying on with her swift black
wings, it seemed to Rodolfo that she did not fly, but hobble on
crutches, so great was his impatience to be alone with his beloved
bride. The longed-for hour came at last: every one retired to rest: the
whole house was buried in silence; but not so shall be the truth of this
story, which will be kept alive in the memory of men by the many
children and descendants of that illustrious house in Toledo, where that
happy pair still live, and have, for many prosperous years, enjoyed the
society of each other, their children, and their grandchildren, by the
blessing of Heaven, and through the force of that blood which was seen
shed on the ground by the valorous, illustrious, and Christian
grandfather of the little Luis.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00016"><a id="THE_JEALOUS_ESTRAMADURAN"/>THE JEALOUS ESTRAMADURAN.</h2>
<p>Not many years ago there issued from a town in Estramadura a hidalgo
nobly born, who, like another prodigal son, went about various parts of
Spain, Italy, and Flanders, squandering his years and his wealth. At
last, after long peregrinations, his parents being dead and his fortune
spent, he made his appearance in the great city of Seville, where he
found abundant opportunity to get rid of the little he had left. Finding
himself then so bare of money, and not better provided with friends, he
adopted the remedy to which many a spendthrift in that city has
recourse; that is, to betake themselves to the Indies, the refuge of the
despairing sons of Spain, the church of the homeless, the asylum of
homicides, the haven of gamblers and cheats, the general receptacle for
loose women, the common centre of attraction for many, but effectual
resource of very few. A fleet being about to sail for Tierrafirma, he
agreed with the admiral for a passage, got ready his sea-stores and his
shroud of Spanish grass cloth, and embarking at Cadiz, gave his
benediction to Spain, intending never to see it again. The fleet slipped
from its moorings, and, amidst the general glee of its living freight,
the sails were spread to the soft and prosperous gale, which soon wafted
them out of sight of land into the wide domains of the great father of
waters, the ocean.</p>
<p>Our passenger now became very thoughtful, revolving in his memory the
many and various dangers he had passed in the years of his
peregrinations, and the thriftless conduct he had pursued all his life
long. The result of the account to which he thus called himself was a
firm resolution to change his way of life, to keep a much better hold of
whatever wealth God might yet be pleased to bestow upon him, and to
behave with more reserve towards women than he had hitherto done.</p>
<p>The fleet was nearly becalmed whilst the mind of Felipe de Carrizales
was actuated by these reflections. The wind soon after rose and became
so boisterous that Carrizales had enough to do to keep on his legs, and
was obliged to leave off his meditations, and concern himself only with
the affairs of his voyage. It was so prosperous that they arrived
without check or accident at the port of Cartagena. To shorten the
introduction of my narrative and avoid all irrelevant matter, I content
myself with saying that Felipe was about eight-and-forty years of age
when he went to the Indies, and that in the twenty years he remained
there he succeeded, by dint of industry and thrift, in amassing more
than a hundred and fifty thousand crowns. Seeing himself once more rich
and prosperous, he was moved by the natural desire, which all men
experience, to return to his native country. Rejecting therefore great
opportunities for profit which presented themselves to him, he quitted
Peru, where he had amassed his wealth, turned all his money into ingots,
and putting it on board a registered ship, to avoid accidents, returned
to Spain, landed at San Lucar, and arrived at Seville, loaded alike with
years and riches.</p>
<p>Having placed his property in safety, he went in search of his friends,
and found they were all dead. He then thought of retiring to his native
place, and ending his days there, although he had ascertained that death
had not left him one survivor of his kindred; and if, when he went to
the Indies poor and needy, he had no rest from the thoughts that
distracted him in the midst of the wide ocean, he was now no less
assailed by care, but from a different cause. Formerly his poverty would
not let him sleep, and now his wealth disturbed his rest; for riches are
as heavy a burden to one who is not used to them, or knows not how to
employ them, as indigence to one who is continually under its pressure.
Money and the want of it alike bring care; but in the one case the
acquisition of a moderate quantity affords a remedy; the other case
grows worse by further acquisition. Carrizales contemplated his ingots
with anxiety, not as a miser, for, during the few years he had been a
soldier, he had learned to be liberal; but from not knowing what to do
with them; for to hoard them was unprofitable, and keeping them in his
house was offering a temptation to thieves. On the other hand, all
inclination for resuming the anxious life of traffic had died out in
him, and at his time of life his actual wealth was more than enough for
the rest of his days. He would fain have spent them in his native place,
put out his money there to interest, and passed his old age in peace and
quiet, giving what he could to God, since he had given more than he
ought to the world. He considered, however, that the penury of his
native place was great, the inhabitants very needy, and that to go and
live there would be to offer himself as a mark for all the importunities
with which the poor usually harass a rich neighbour, especially when
there is only one in the place to whom they can have recourse in their
distress.</p>
<p>He wanted some one to whom he might leave his property after his death,
and with that view, taking measure of the vigour of his constitution, he
concluded that he was not yet too old to bear the burthen of matrimony.
But immediately on conceiving this notion, he was seized with such a
terrible fear as scattered it like a mist before the wind. He was
naturally the most jealous man in the world, even without being married,
and the mere thought of taking a wife called up such horrible spectres
before his imagination that he resolved by all means to remain a
bachelor.</p>
<p>That point was settled; but it was not yet settled what he should do
with the rest of his life, when it chanced that, passing one day through
a street, he looked up and saw at a window a young girl apparently about
thirteen or fourteen, with a face so very handsome and so very pleasing
in its expression, that poor old Carrizales was vanquished at once, and
surrendered without an effort to the charms of the beautiful Leonora,
for that was the girl's name. Without more ado, he began to string
together a long train of arguments to the following effect:—"This girl
is very handsome, and to judge from the appearance of the house, her
parents cannot be rich. She is almost a child too; assuredly a wife of
her age could not give a husband any uneasiness. Let me see: say that I
marry her; I will keep her close at home, I will train her up to my own
hand, and so fashion her to my wishes that she will never have a thought
beyond them! I am not so old but that I may yet hope to have children to
inherit my wealth. Whether she brings me any dower or not is a matter of
no consideration, since Heaven has given me enough for both, and rich
people should not look for money with a wife, but for enjoyment, for
that prolongs life, whereas jarring discontent between married people
makes it wear out faster than it would do otherwise. So be it then; the
die is cast, and this is the wife whom heaven destines me to have."</p>
<p>Having thus soliloquised, not once but a hundred times on that day, and
the two or three following, Carrizales had an interview with Leonora's
parents, and found that, although poor, they were persons of good birth.
He made known his intention to them, acquainted them with his condition
and fortune, and begged them very earnestly to bestow their daughter
upon him in marriage. They required time to consider his proposal, and
to give him also an opportunity to satisfy himself that their birth and
quality was such as they had stated.</p>
<p>The parties took leave of each other, made the necessary inquiries,
found them satisfactory on both sides, and finally Leonora was betrothed
to Carrizales, who settled upon her twenty thousand ducats, so hotly
enamoured was the jealous old bridegroom. But no sooner had he
pronounced the conjugal "yes," than he was all at once assailed by a
host of rabid fancies; he began to tremble without cause and to find his
cares and anxieties come thicker and faster upon him than ever. The
first proof he gave of his jealous temper was, in resolving that no
tailor should take measure of his betrothed for any of the many wedding
garments he intended to present her. Accordingly, he went about looking
for some other woman, who might be nearly of the same height and figure
as Leonora. He found a poor woman, who seemed suitable for his purpose,
and having had a gown made to her measure, he tried it on his betrothed,
found that it fitted well, and gave orders that it should serve as a
pattern for all the other dresses, which were so many and so rich that
the bride's parents thought themselves fortunate beyond measure, in
having obtained for themselves and their daughter a son-in-law and a
husband so nobly munificent. As for Leonora, she was at her wit's end
with amazement at the sight of such gorgeous finery, for the best she
had ever worn in her life had been but a serge petticoat and a silk
jacket.</p>
<p>The second proof of jealousy given by Felipe was, that he would not
consummate his marriage until he had provided a house after his own
fancy, which he arranged in this singular manner. He bought one for
twelve thousand ducats, in one of the best wards of the city, with a
fountain and pond, and a garden well stocked with orange trees. He put
screens before all the windows that looked towards the street, leaving
them no other prospect than the sky, and did much the same with all the
others in the house. In the gateway next the street, he erected a stable
for a mule, and over it a straw loft, and a room for an old black
eunuch, who was to take care of the mule. He raised the parapets round
the flat roof of the house so high, that nothing could be seen above
them but the sky, and that only by turning one's face upwards. In the
inner door, opening from the gateway upon the quadrangle, he fixed a
turning box like that of a convent, by means of which articles were to
be received from without. He furnished the house in a sumptuous style,
such as would have become the mansion of a great lord; and he bought
four white slave girls, whom he branded in the face, and two negresses.
For the daily supplies of his establishment he engaged a purveyor, who
was to make all the necessary purchases, but was not to sleep in the
house or ever enter it further than to the second door, where he was to
deposit what he had brought in the turning box. Having made these
arrangements, Carrizales invested part of his money in sundry good
securities; part he placed in the bank, and the rest he kept by him to
meet any emergencies that might arise. He also had a master key made for
his whole house; and he laid up a whole year's store of all such things
as it is usual to purchase in bulk at their respective seasons; and
everything being now ready to his mind, he went to his father-in-law's
house and claimed his bride, whom her parents delivered up to him with
no few tears, for it seemed to them as if they were giving her up for
burial.</p>
<p>Leonora knew not, poor young creature, what was before her, but she shed
tears because she saw her parents weep, and taking leave of them with
their blessing, she went to her new home, her husband leading her by the
hand, and her slaves and servants attending her. On their arrival
Carrizales harangued all his domestics, enjoining them to keep careful
watch over Leonora, and by no means, on any pretence whatsoever, to
allow anybody to enter within the second gate, not even the black
eunuch. But the person whom above all others he charged with the safe
keeping and due entertainment of his wife was a dueña of much prudence
and gravity, whom he had taken to be Leonora's monitress, and
superintendent of the whole house, and to command the slaves and two
other maidens of Leonora's age whom he had also added to his family,
that his wife might not be without companions of her own years. He
promised them all that he would treat them so well, and take such care
for their comfort and gratification, that they should not feel their
confinement, and that on holidays they should every one of them without
exception be allowed to go to mass; but so early in the morning that
daylight itself should scarcely have a chance of seeing them. The
servant maids and the slaves promised to obey all his orders cheerfully
and with prompt alacrity and the bride, with a timid shrinking of her
shoulders, bowed her head, and said that she had no other will than that
of her lord and spouse, to whom she always owed obedience.</p>
<p>Having thus laid down the law for the government of his household, the
worthy Estramaduran began to enjoy, as well as he could, the fruits of
matrimony, which, to Leonora's inexperienced taste, were neither
sweet-flavoured nor insipid. Her days were spent with her dueña, her
damsels, and her slaves, who, to make the time pass more agreeably, took
to pampering their palates, and few days passed in which they did not
make lots of things in which they consumed a great deal of honey and
sugar. Their master gladly supplied them with all they could wish for in
that way without stint, for by that means he expected to keep them
occupied and amused, so that they should have no time to think of their
confinement and seclusion. Leonora lived on a footing of equality with
her domestics, amused herself as they did, and even in her simplicity
took pleasure in dressing dolls and other childish pastime. All this
afforded infinite satisfaction to the jealous husband; it seemed to him
that he had chosen the best way of life imaginable, and that it was not
within the compass of human art or malice to trouble his repose:
accordingly his whole care was devoted to anticipating his wife's wishes
by all sorts of presents, and encouraging her to ask for whatever came
into her head, for in everything it should be his pleasure to gratify
her.</p>
<p>On the days she went to mass, which as we have said was before daylight,
her parents attended at church and talked with their daughter in
presence of her husband, who made them such liberal gifts as mitigated
the keenness of their compassion for the secluded life led by their
daughter. Carrizales used to get up in the morning and watch for the
arrival of the purveyor, who was always made aware of what was wanted
for the day by means of a note placed over-night in the turning box.
After the purveyor had come and gone, Carrizales used to go abroad,
generally on foot, locking both entrance doors behind him—that next the
street, and that which opened on the quadrangle,—and leaving the negro
shut up between them. Having despatched his business, which was not
much, he speedily returned, shut himself up in his house, and occupied
himself in making much of his wife and her handmaids, who all liked him
for his placid and agreeable humour, and above all for his great
liberality towards them. In this way they passed a year of novitiate,
and made profession of that manner of life, resolved every one of them
to continue in it to the end of their days; and so it would have been,
if the crafty perturber of the human race had not brought their chaste
purposes to nought, as you shall presently hear.</p>
<p>Now, I ask the most long-headed and wary of my readers, what more could
old Felipe have done in the way of taking precautions for his security,
since he would not even allow that there should be any male animal
within his dwelling? No tom-cat ever persecuted its rats, nor was the
barking of a dog ever heard within its walls; all creatures belonging to
it were of the feminine gender. He took thought by day, and by night he
did not sleep; he was himself the patrol and sentinel of his house, and
the Argus of what he held dear. Never did a man set foot within the
quadrangle; he transacted his business with his friends in the street;
the pictures that adorned his rooms were all female figures, flowers, or
landscapes; his whole dwelling breathed an odour of propriety,
seclusion, and circumspection; the very tales which the maid servants
told by the fireside in the long winter nights, being told in his
presence, were perfectly free from the least tinge of wantonness. Her
aged spouse's silver hairs seemed in Leonora's eyes locks of pure gold;
for the first love known by maidens imprints itself on their hearts like
a seal on melted wax. His inordinate watchfulness seemed to her no more
than the due caution of an experienced and judicious man. She was fully
persuaded that the life she led was the same as that led by all married
women. Her thoughts never wandered beyond the walls of her dwelling, nor
had she a wish that was not the same as her husband's. It was only on
the days she went to mass that she set eyes on the streets, and that was
so early in the morning, that except on the way home she had not light
to look about her. Never was there seen a convent more closely barred
and bolted; never were nuns kept more recluse, or golden apples better
guarded; and yet for all his precautions poor Felipe could not help
falling into the pit he dreaded,—or at least believing that he had so
fallen.</p>
<p>There is in Seville an idle pleasure-seeking class of people who are
commonly called men on town,<a id="FNanchor_80_80"/><a href="957359822497415135_14420-h-12.htm.html#Footnote_80_80" class="pginternal"><sup>[80]</sup></a> a sauntering, sprucely dressed,
mellifluous race, always finding means to make, themselves welcome at
rich men's feasts. Of these people, their manners and customs, and the
laws they observe among themselves, I should have much to say, but
abstain from it for good reasons. One of these gallants, a bachelor,—or
a <i>virote</i>, as such persons are called in their jargon, the newly
married being styled <i>matones</i>,—took notice of the house of Carrizales,
and seeing it always shut close, he was curious to know who lived there.
He set about this inquiry with such ardour and ingenuity, that he failed
not to obtain all the information he desired. He learned the character
and habits of the old man, the beauty of Leonora, and the singular
method adopted by her husband in order to keep her safe. All this
inflamed him with desire to see if it would not be possible, by force or
stratagem, to effect the reduction of so well-guarded a fortress. He
imparted his thoughts to three of his friends, and they all agreed that
he should go to work, for in such an enterprise no one lacks counsellors
to aid and abet him. At first they were at a loss how to set about so
difficult an exploit; but after many consultations they agreed upon the
following plan:—Loaysa (so the virote was named) disappeared from
among his friends, giving out that he was leaving Seville for some time.
Then drawing on a pair of linen drawers and a clean shirt, he put over
them a suit of clothes so torn and patched, that the poorest beggar in
the city would have disdained to wear such rags. He shaved off the
little beard he had, covered one of his eyes with a plaster, tied up one
of his legs, and hobbling along on two crutches, appeared so completely
metamorphosed into a lame beggar, that no real cripple could have looked
less of a counterfeit than he.</p>
<p>In this guise he posted himself closely at the hour of evening prayer
before the door of Carrizales' house, which was fast shut, and Luis the
negro locked up between the two doors. Having taken up his position
there, Loaysa produced a greasy guitar, wanting some of its strings, and
as he was something of a musician, he began to play a few lovely airs,
and to sing Moorish ballads in a feigned voice, with so much expression
that all who were passing through the street stopped to listen. The boys
all made a ring round him when he sang, and Luis the negro, enchanted by
the virote's music, would have given one of his hands to be able to open
the door, and listen to him more at his ease, such is the fondness for
music inherent in the negro race. When Loaysa wanted to get rid of his
audience, he had only to cease singing, put up his guitar, and hobble
away on his crutches.</p>
<p>Loaysa four or five times repeated this serenade to the negro, for whose
sake alone he played and sang, thinking that the way to succeed in his
sap and siege was to begin by making sure of old Luis; nor was his
expectation disappointed. One night when he had taken his place as usual
before the door, and had begun to time his guitar, perceiving that the
negro was already on the alert, he put his lips to the key-hole and
whispered, "Can you give me a drop of water, Luis? I am dying with
thirst, and can't sing."</p>
<p>"No," said the negro, "for I have not the key of this door, and there is
no hole through which I can give you drink."</p>
<p>"Who keeps the key, then?"</p>
<p>"My master, who is the most jealous man in the world; and if he knew
that I was now talking here with any one, it were pity of my life. But
who are you who ask me for water?"</p>
<p>"I am a poor cripple, who get my bread by asking alms of all good people
in God's name; besides which I teach the guitar to some moriscoes, and
other poor people. Among my pupils I have three negroes, slaves to three
aldermen, whom I have taught so well that they are fit to sing and play
at dance or in any tavern, and they have paid me for it very well
indeed."</p>
<p>"A deal better would I pay you to have the opportunity of taking
lessons; but it is not possible, for when my master goes out in the
morning he locks the door behind him, and he does the same when he comes
in, leaving me shut up between two doors."</p>
<p>"I vow to God, Luis, if you would only contrive to let me in a few
nights to give you lessons, in less than a fortnight I would make you
such a dabster at the guitar, that you need not be ashamed to play at
any street corner; for I would have you to know that I have an
extraordinary knack in teaching; moreover, I have heard tell that you
have a very promising capacity, and from what I can judge from the tone
of your voice, you must sing very well."</p>
<p>"I don't sing; badly; but what good is that since I don't know any
tunes, except the 'Star of Venus,' or, 'In the green meadow,' or the
tune that is now so much in vogue, 'Clinging to her grated window, with
a trembling hand?'"</p>
<p>"All these are moonshine to what I could teach you, for I know all the
ballads of the Moor Abendaraez, with those of his lady Xarifa, and all
those comprising the history of the grand sofi Tomunibeyo, and the
divine sarabands which enchant the souls of the Portuguese themselves,
among whom they are most in vogue; and all these I teach by such methods
and with such facility, that almost before you have swallowed three or
four bushels of salt, you will find yourself an out-and-out performer in
every kind of guitar music."</p>
<p>"What's the good of all that," (here the negro sighed heavily,) "since I
can't get you into the house?"</p>
<p>"There's a remedy for all things: contrive to take the keys from your
master, and I will give you a piece of wax, with which you may take an
impression of the wards, for I have taken such a liking to you, I will
get a locksmith, a friend of mine, to make new keys, and then I can come
in at night and teach you to play better than Prester John in the
Indies. It is a thousand pities that a voice like yours should be lost
for want of the accompaniment of the guitar; for I would have you to
know, brother Luis, that the finest voice in the world loses its
perfection when it is not accompanied by some instrument, be it guitar
or harpsichord, organ or harp; but the instrument that will suit your
voice best is the guitar, because it is the handiest and the least
costly of all."</p>
<p>"All that is very good; but the thing can't be done, for I never get
hold of the keys, nor does my master ever let them out of his keeping;
day and night they sleep under his pillow."</p>
<p>"Well, then, there's another thing you may do, if so be you have made up
a mind to be a first-rate musician; if you haven't, I need not bother
myself with advising you."</p>
<p>"Have a mind, do you say? Ay, and to that degree that there is nothing I
wouldn't do, if it were possible anyhow, for sake of being able to play
music."</p>
<p>"Well, if that's the case, you have only to scrape away a little mortar
from the gate-post near the hinge, and I will give you, through that
opening, a pair of pincers and a hammer, with which you may by night
draw out the nails of the staple, and we can easily put that to rights
again, so that no one will ever suspect that the lock was opened. Once
shut up with you in your loft, or wherever you sleep, I will go to work
in such style that you will turn out even better than I said, to my own
personal advantage, and to the increase of your accomplishments. You
need not give yourself any concern about what we shall have to eat. I
will bring enough to last us both for more than a week, for I have
pupils who will not let me be pinched."</p>
<p>"As for that matter we are all right; for with what my master allows me,
and the leavings brought me by the slave-girls, we should have enough
for two more besides ourselves. Only bring the hammer and pincers, and I
will make an opening close to the hinge, through which you may pass them
in, and I will stop it up again with mud. I will take the fastenings out
of the lock, and even should it be necessary to give some loud knocks,
my master sleeps so far off from this gate, that it must be either a
miracle or our extraordinary ill luck if he hears them."</p>
<p>"Well, then, with the blessing of God, friend Luis, in two days from
this time you shall have everything necessary for the execution of your
laudable purpose. Meanwhile, take care not to eat such things as are apt
to make phlegm, for they do the voice no good, but a deal of harm."</p>
<p>"Nothing makes me so hoarse so much as wine, but I would not give it up
for all the voices above ground."</p>
<p>"Don't think I would have you do so; God forbid! Drink, Luis my boy,
drink; and much good may it do you, for wine drunk in measure never did
any one harm."</p>
<p>"I always drink in measure. I have a jug here that holds exactly three
pints and a half. The girls fill this for me unknown to my master, and
the purveyor brings me on the sly a bottle holding a good gallon, which
makes up for the deficiency of the jug."</p>
<p>"That's the way to live, my boy, for a dry throat can neither grunt nor
sing."</p>
<p>"Well, go your ways now, and God be with you; but don't forget to come
and sing here every night until such time as you bring the tools for
getting you within doors. My fingers itch to be at the guitar."</p>
<p>"I'll come, never fear, and I'll bring some new tunes too."</p>
<p>"Ay, do; but before you go away now, sing me something that I may go to
sleep pleasantly; and for the matter of payment, be it known to the
<i>señor pobre</i> that I will be more liberal than many a rich man."</p>
<p>"Oh, I ain't uneasy on that score. If you think I teach you well, I will
leave it to yourself to pay me accordingly. And now I'll just sing you
one song, but when I am inside you will see wonders."</p>
<p>Here ended this long dialogue, and Loaysa sang a sprightly ditty with
such good effect, that the negro was in ecstacies, and felt as if the
time for opening the door would never arrive.</p>
<p>Having finished his song, Loaysa took his departure, and set off at a
rounder pace than might have been expected of a man on crutches, to
report to his friends what a good beginning he had made. He told them
what he had concerted with the negro, and the following day they
procured tools of the right sort, fit to break any fastening as if it
was made of straw. The virote failed not to serenade the negro, nor the
latter to scrape at the gate-post till he had made a sufficiently wide
hole, which he plastered up so well, that no one could perceive it
unless he searched for it on purpose. On the second night Loaysa passed
in the tools, Luis went to work with them, whipped off the staple in a
trice, opened the door, and let in his Orpheus. Great was his surprise
to see him on his two crutches, with such a distorted leg, and in such a
tattered plight. Loaysa did not wear the patch over his eye, for it was
not necessary, and as soon as he entered he embraced his pupil, kissed
him on the cheek, and immediately put into his hand a big jar of wine, a
box of preserves, and other sweet things, with which his wallet was well
stored. Then throwing aside his crutches, he began to cut capers, as if
nothing ailed him, to the still greater amazement of the negro.</p>
<p>"You must know, brother Luis," said Loaysa, "that my lameness does not
come of natural infirmity, but from my own ingenious contrivance,
whereby I get my bread, asking alms for the love of God. In this way,
and with the help of my music, I lead the merriest life in the world,
where others, with less cleverness and good management, would be starved
to death. Of this you will be convinced in the course of our
friendship."</p>
<p>"We shall see," said the negro; "but now let us put this staple back in
its place, so that it may not appear that it has been moved."</p>
<p>"Very good," said Loaysa, and taking out some nails from his wallet, he
soon made the lock seem as secure as ever, to the great satisfaction of
the negro, who, taking him at once to his loft, made him as comfortable
there as he could. Luis lighted a lamp; Loaysa took up his guitar, and
began to strike the chords softly and sweetly, so that the poor negro
was transported with delight. After he had played awhile, he drew forth
a fresh supply of good things for a collation, which they partook of
together, and the pupil applied himself so earnestly to the bottle that
it took away his senses still more than the music had done. Supper over,
Loaysa proposed that Luis should take his first lesson at once; and
though the poor negro was too much fuddled to distinguish one string
from another, Loaysa made him believe that he had already learnt at
least two notes. So persuaded was the poor fellow of this, that he did
nothing all night but jangle and strum away. They had but a short sleep
that night. In the morning, just on the strike of six, Carrizales came
down, opened both entrance doors, and stood waiting for the purveyor,
who came soon afterwards; and after depositing the day's supplies in the
turning-box, called the negro down to receive his ration and oats for
the mule. After the purveyor was gone, old Carrizales went out, locking
both doors after him, without having seen what had been done to the lock
of one of them, whereat both master and pupil rejoiced not a little.</p>
<p>No sooner was the master of the house gone, than the negro laid hold on
the guitar, and began to scrape it in such a manner, that all the
servant maids came to the second door, and asked him, through the
turning-box, "What is this, Luis? How long have you had a guitar? Who
gave it you?"</p>
<p>"Who gave it me? The best musician in the world, and one who is to teach
me in six days more than six thousand tunes!"</p>
<p>"Where is he, this musician?" said the dueña.</p>
<p>"He is not far off," replied the negro; "and if it were not for fear of
my master, perhaps I would tell you where at once, and I warrant you
would be glad to see him."</p>
<p>"But where can he be for us to see him," returned the dueña, "since no
one but our master ever enters this house?"</p>
<p>"I will not tell you any more about the matter till you have heard what
I can do, and how much he has taught me in this short time."</p>
<p>"By my troth, unless he is a demon who has taught you, I don't know how
you can have become a musician all at once."</p>
<p>"Stop a bit and you shall hear him, and mayhap you will see him too some
day."</p>
